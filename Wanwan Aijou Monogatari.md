# Introduction

Wanwan Aijou Monogatari is a visual novel for the Casio Loopy about growing up. And cute doggies :3 You may know it by its scenario writer Kenji Terada, known for his work on several Final Fantasy games, and dozens of anime and films.

Play is linear, punctuated by several simple games. All games can be retried if you make a mistake. Several of the games rely on Japanese wordplay and culture, so we'll add translator notes [in brackets] and sometimes include corresponding Japanese text to help identify choices.

The game autosaves as you progress, at "scene" breaks. There are 12 chapters, which are split further into these scenes, though the chapter and scene number aren't onscreen or anything, the chapters are indicated in this translation.

Since this is a Loopy game, of course there are some stickers to print. However, unlike the creation-centric games, you won't have an opportunity to print anything until you've cleared the game: the stickers are a reward for finishing the story.

That said, I'm excited to share a save trainer I developed: [wan.loopy.land](https://wan.loopy.land/). With this tool you can generate a cleared save with any names you desire (including names that are impossible to enter normally, using A-Z characters as well as some kanji). The save it generates can be used in flashcarts (like the Floopy Drive) or emulators (like Loopy My Seal Emulator), or can be written to a genuine Wanwan cartridge (with the Open Source Cart Reader and its Loopy adapter).

# Main Scenario

Papa: I'm back!

Momo: Ahh, papa! Welcome home!

Mama: Welcome home, dear!

Papa: Momo, were you a good girl today?

Momo: Papa! I'm not a LITTLE KID any more!

Papa: Haha, is that right? But... today is a special day, isn't it?

Momo: Papa, you remembered? Today is Momo's birthday!

Papa: Of course! Well! Your present is in this room. Do you wanna look for it?

Momo: Whaaa?! What could it be?

Puppy: *whimper*

Momo: Eh? EHH?? Just now, was there a whimper??

Puppy: *Wan! Wan!*

Momo: UWAAAA! KAWAIII!!!! A PUPPYYYYY!!!!

Momo: PAPA!! A PUPPYYYYY!

Puppy: *Wan!*

Mama: Ahh! A puppy! And what a cutie!

Papa: Hahaha, well, it has been quite a while since our old dog, Captain, passed away, hasn't it?

Mama: Momo-chan, won't you give our new family member a name?

Momo: Uhu, kawaii!!! A name... What should it be...

Papa: What name will you choose for the puppy? Use the D-pad, A button, B button erases.

[Doggie's name here. We're using the default name Barley! Use 変 to change between hiragana and katakana, and 終 to confirm.]

Papa: Barley.

👉Yes / No

Momo: Barley, your name is Barley. Got it?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Barley! Barley! Kawwwwaiii!

Momo: Such big ears! Hehe, looks like you could fly through the air.

Momo: Papa! THANK YOU!!

Mama: Momo. A puppy is a living thing, so you must cherish him and raise him well, you know.

Mama: You must not get tired of him or neglect him!

Papa: That's right, and you must train him well.

Momo: Train?

Papa: That's right. To start, it'd be best to teach him "sit".

Momo: How do we do that?

Papa: Papa will show you, so watch closely.

Papa: Okay, Momo? So, tap here, on Barley's back... and say "Sit!"

Papa: Barley...

Papa: Sit!

Papa: Barley, Barley!

Papa: Sit! Barley, sit!

Papa: Good! Good! You're a very smart boy, Barley! You get it now?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Papa: Gooood! Good boy, good boy!

Papa: So, Momo. Please try it like Papa showed you.

Momo: Okay!

- 👉Teach "sit"

Momo: Barley!

Momo: Sit!

Momo: Barley, sit!

Barley: .....

Momo: Barley! Sit!

Barley: ??? *Wan wan!*

Momo: Papaaaa.... Barley won't sit...

Papa: Don't give up, Momo. Try one more time.

Momo: OK.

Barley: *sits*

Momo: YATTA!!! WONDERFUL, Barley!!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Papa, Barley learned "sit"!

Papa: Goooood! Well! Next up is "fetch!"

Papa: Watch closely how Papa does this.

Papa: Barley!

Barley: *Wan!*

Papa: Barley. See the ball over there?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Papa: Momo, show Barley the ball there.

Momo: OK!

Momo: Barley!

Momo: Over here! The ball's over here!

Papa: Barley, over there. There's the ball.

Barley: *Wan!*

Papa: Yes, Barley! Go get it!

Papa: Barley. Bring me the ball! Ball!

Barley: *Brings it*

Momo: Yatta!!!

Barley: *Happy yip yap!!*

Papa: Good, just like that. Momo, now you try.

Momo: OK!

Momo: Barley, come here!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Barley, ball! That ball! Bring me that ball!

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Barley.....

Barley: *sniff sniff*

Momo: No, Barley....

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Momo: Barley! Go get the ball! Please!

Barley: *Yawn*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Momo: .....Barley!! BALL! GET THE BALL!

Barley: *whimper*

Papa: Momo... Momo, you're getting a little frustrated, aren't you?

Momo: Huh?!

Papa: Barley has a heart, you know. Since Barley won't do what you want, you got a little frustrated, right? Barley is very sensitive. He can understand your body language... and he won't come to you if you're irritated.

Mama: Right. So if Barley fetches even once, maybe you should lavish him with praise! That would make him happy, very happy. If you do that, Barley might bring you the ball to get that praise again!

Momo: Ohhhh..... OK, I got it! I won't get frustrated! I'll praise him a bunch!... Right?

Momo: Let's try it!

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Momo: Barley. Bring me the ball! Ball. The ball!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Look, Barley. Over there. Bring me that ball.

Momo: *Wan?*

Momo: Yes! Bring that ball!

Momo: *hehe*

Momo: Nooo, Barley. Hm, he doesn't get it...

Momo: Look, Barley. There. That ball.

Barley: *Wan wan! Wan wan!*

Momo: .....!!

Barley: *almoooost*

Papa: Look, Barley! Over to Momo!

Momo: Barley, bring me that ball like a good boy! Barley!

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Barley! Bring it. Bring it here!

Barley: *Fetches like a champ*

Momo: Barley..... YOU DID IT! YOU FETCHED!

Momo: Barley! Wonderful! Wonderful! Barley is a very good boy!

Momo: Papa, Mama, Barley finally learned how to fetch!

Mama: Yes, very good, Momo!

Papa: I think Barley might have understood your heart, Momo.

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Mama: Sleep is very important for a puppy, isn't it? It would be very very bad for him to get sick. So! Let's put him to bed, shall we?

Momo: Haaaai.

Papa: Tomorrow you can play with the ball, Momo.

Momo: That's right! Good night, Barley!

## At home

Papa: It's Sunday today, so it'd be nice to go to the park and play ball with Barley.

Momo: Yeah! Let's go! Barley!!

Barley: *Wan! Wan!*

Momo: Be back sooooon!

Mama: Take care!

## At the park (Chapter 2)

Momo: Good, Barley! Can you fetch this? Here we go!

- 👉Throw gently
- Throw hard

Momo: Here goes!

Momo: Barley, amazing! You learned how to fetch perfectly!

Momo: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

Momo: There!

Barley: *Epic jump catch*

Momo: Awesome, Barley! How come you can do that, I never taught you!

Momo: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Okaaay, this next one is gonna be hard, think you can do it?

Momo: Okay, here we go, Barley! THERE!

Barley: *Jumps into bush*

Momo: Barley, you there?

Momo: ....Barleyyy?

Momo: Barley, Barley! Come! Come back!

Momo: Barleyyy. (While calling out Barley's name, I got hungry all of a sudden...)

Momo: Barleyyy.... What happened...?

Barley: *Jumps out with a definitely not creepy doll*

Momo: Barley!

Momo: What were you doinnng? I was worrrieedd!

Momo: Wh, what's that? You picked up something other than the ball...

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: That... That doll, where do I...?

Momo: Oh... Long ago, when we had to move here...

Momo: Umm, hmmm...

Momo: It was really important, so why can't I remember...

Momo: Judy... That's it! This is Judy!!!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Judy: YOU REMEMBERED ME, MOMO-CHAN!!!

Momo: Eh? Eh?? EEHHHH???

Judy: Momo-chan! Momoland... it's-

Judy: Quick, quick! It's in danger... it's in danger...

*A mustachioed alarm clock jumps out of the bush*

Clock: Aaahhhhhh, aaah, ahem! Greetings!

Momo: W-wh-why!?? This.... alarm clock... is... moving?!

Judy: Shut up!! As I was saying, MOMOLAND IS IN PERIL!

Judy: SO, Momo-chan, we've gotta go back to Momoland!

Momo: Eh? EEEEEHHH?? What are you saying?!

Momo: I don't understand!

Clock: Ahem! Ahem!

Clock: For a subject of Momoland, you are acting most deplorable, Judy.

Clock: As the caretaker of the Door of Time, I must beg your forgiveness for coming to the World of Reality at my own regrettable pace.

Clock: Yes, I have returned, I have returned!

Judy: Ugh, I have to put up with this? Will you be quiet, old man!?

Clock: Hmf...

Clock: Ahem! You may call me Clock!

Clock: As I was saying, I am the keeper of the Door of Time, that connects Momoland and the World of Reality.

Clock: Well, I am sorry, Momo-chan, we must be getting back to Juku.

[Nobody ever fully explains what "Juku" is. Literally it usually refers to a cram school or a private school, but in compound words it can connote "maturity". Technically before "cram school", "juku" referred to rooms on the side of a gate. All these could be meanings here, as Clock is master of the gate of time which separates childhood and adulthood. What's most likely is that Juku is the proper name of the gate he keeps, the "Gate of Maturity."]

Judy: Ugh! Enough about Juku, who cares!

Judy: Please, Momo-chan, there's no time. Look at this!

Momo: That's... Whose photo album is that?

Momo: .....That's my album!

Momo: How? Why?!

Momo: EEEH? The photo, it.... vanished!

Judy: Something terrible is happening in Momo-land!

Judy: If things keep going this way, Momo-chan's memories will ALL BE GONE!

Judy: If I was just a little bit later, even your memory of me might have died...

Clock: Judy, the closing of the Door of Time will soon be upon us! Let us return!

Judy: Please, Momo-chan! Please don't forget about me!

Judy: We're friends forever, right?

Momo: Of- Of course we're friends, Judy!

Momo: But, WHERE is Momoland?

Momo: So I have to go to "Juku" and...?

Clock: It is time, Judy! In 20 seconds... 19...

Momo: But I still have questions! ...And if I'm late for dinner, Papa will scold me...

Clock: 15... 14... 13...

Momo: Umm.... l- look, even if we were to go to Momoland, don't we need to prepare?

Momo: You know, like, things we need to bring, and... making arrangements...

Clock: 10... Judy, there's no time!

Clock: 8... Do you want to be stuck here!? 7...

Judy: Momo-chan! It's like I said... so... let's go!

Judy: I can explain better after we get there!

Momo: Eeehh! Judy!!!

Momo: Mr. Clock!

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Ah... Barley! Oh... wait for meeeeeeeeee!

## Forest (Chapter 3)

Voice: -chan...

Voice: Momo-chan? Momo-chan!

Momo: ...Mama? What time is it?

Barley: *lick*

Momo: Kya! Barley... Where am i?

Clock: Momo-chan, this is Momoland.

Momo: Mr. Clock... Judy...!

Momo: We really came to... the land of memories...

Judy: Is Momo-chan going to be okay?

Clock: As we were not able to get to Juku in time, we are in a predicament...

Judy: Of course we're in a "predicament"!

Clock: Not "of course", Judy. Carelessly allowing so much time to elapse is a serious matter!

Judy: UGHHH! Don't you ever shut up about "time", "time", "time"!?

Judy: Don't tell me you've never been just a teeny, tiny, little bit late yourself!

Clock: Never.

Clock: I have periodic maintenance once every two months, without fail. Therefore, I am never late, not even a single second.

Momo: ... I guess there's no fighting it, we're here now... We gotta do what we gotta do...

Momo: So, Judy, what should we do?

Judy: To tell the truth, Veggies have been stirring up a rebellion here in Momoland. It's like, a big pain for everyone!

Judy: Even Judy's favorite ribbon was taken...

Judy: The disappearance of Momo-chan's memories is also their doing.

Momo: But why would... vegetables... do that kind of thing?

Judy: It's the "Dark Lord Cabbage"! He's their super evil leader!

Judy: He's the one ordering the Veggies around.

Momo: Dark Lord Cabbage?

Judy: The way I heard it, Dark Lord Cabbage is gradually eating your memories...

Judy: Momo-chan, it seemed like even your memories of me would be forgotten!!!

Momo: Dark Lord Cabbage...

Momo: So unless I defeat this guy, my cherished memories will vanish, huh?

Clock: Ahem. Momo-chan. It seems we have dragged you along and gotten you involved in this turmoil, but as a citizen of the World of Reality, walking about Momoland is simply unacceptable.

Clock: So! I have made arrangements for your return.

Momo: Eh! I can return?

Clock: Naturally, as long as you are together with I, the Keeper of the Door of Time, you may open the door and return home at any time. So let us return!

Judy: Mr. Clock, this is a serious affair, you said so yourself!

Clock: Silence!

Clock: Her presence is strictly prohibited by the 11th article of the Principles of Door Management!

Judy: Why you! This Momoland we're in is the world of Momo's memories, you know.

Clock: So, what are you saying?

Judy: You don't get it yet? All that tick-tocking must have liquefied your brain.

Judy: If this keeps going, and all Momo-chan's memories are taken away; if she turns into an adult with no memories of her childhood, the World of Reality and the World of Memories will be completely severed and set adrift!

Judy: If that happens, you're out of a job! The Door of Time becomes totally obsolete!

Judy: And if nobody needs the Door of Time, nobody needs the *Janitor* of the Door of Time, do they now?!

Clock: Wh- What? Me, become useless?

Clock: That IS a serious affair. I see no helping it, I shall grant you special permission.

Clock: However, I shall accompany you, performing the duty of official overseer.

Clock: Well then, let us briskly and without sluggishness return these memories.

Momo: But... how?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Clock: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH! DOG!! HERE!!! REMAIN CALM!

Momo: Barley, what is it?

Momo: Could Barley have found something that could be a clue?

Judy: If so, he may be small, but he's certainly a very helpful dog!

Momo: Barley, it's all you!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

## Tree

Momo: Huff huff... Barley.... huff... is there something... huff... about this tree?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Voice: Ahhhhh, help meee!

Momo: Was that someone's... voice?

Judy: That voice...

Momo: But it's familiar... Ummm, umm, a bear...

Momo: Errr... That's right! Earb the bear!! It's Earb!

Cukeman: Cyu cyuke, what's dis, youse some kinda friends of Prince Bear over there?

Cukeman: O-ho! Prince Pup's come out to play, cuke.

Cukeman: Think you can answer 'em, Prince Pup?!

Momo: Whaaaaaat!?

## Game: Qucumber Quiz

Shall we go over the rules?

Barley: *barks twice!*

Think carefully before you answer, Momo-chan.

Cukeman: Cuke... it's over... we lost-cuke.

Cukeman: To lose to... to lose to Prince pup....?!

Cukeman: Shoot. You'll regret dis!

Earb: You brought my ear back!

Barley: *wanwan!*

Earb: Thank you!

Momo: Barley, this is Earb.

Barley: *wan!*

Momo: Earb might be a little bit of a crybaby, but he's a very, very sweet bear.

Momo: When I was a little girl, I was afraid of thunder, and I'd cling to Earb.

Momo: Ever since then, Earb has always been by my side, absorbing all my fears.

Momo: How could anyone bully such a sweet bear?

Earb: I, I dunno-mon.

Earb: I was just playing at home when the Dark Lord Cabbage and his Cukemen came...

Earb: *sniffle* My ear... they... tore it up-mon...

Judy: That's horrible!!

Momo: So, you were waiting all this time for us to come?

Earb: That's right-mon.

Earb: Even though I'm afraid of heights, I had to wait it out up in that tree-mon.

Judy: Ah! Wait, is that... possibly... a doghouse?

Momo: I, I recognize that! That's... that's... that's right!

Momo: Captain! Captain's doghouse!

Momo: Barley, when I was little, looong before you came to our house, a dog named Captain lived with us.

Momo: He was also much, muuuch bigger than you.

Momo: Earb, is Captain in this world too!?

Earb: He lives with an old man in a forest wayyyyyyyyyy out there, way beyond that mountain-mon.

Momo: Old man... it couldn't be... grandpa?

Momo: My grandpa... who passed away?!

Earb: That's right-mon.

Momo: I can... I can meet my grandpa again!!

Momo: Earb, how do we get to that forest where grandpa is living?

Earb: I... don't know.... But I heard it's on the other side of that huge mountain, Mt. Elementary.

Clock: But... crossing Mt. Elementary........ that's impossible!

Judy: Momo-chan, Mt. Elementary is a verrry tall mountain! There's no way we can hike over it.

Judy: See? *points to map*

Momo: Oh... well, what should we do...

Earb: It might be best if you take Momo Unit 01.

Earb: Momo Unit 01 can fly through the air!

Momo: Momo Unit 01?

Momo: My tricycle, Momo Unit 01?!

Momo: Speaking of Momo-1... I, I remember! Back in kindergarten, I left it in the sandbox and came back home without it!

Clock: All too common an occurrence among young children, I am afraid. Regrettable, regrettable...

Momo: Sure, it was important to me, but... but FLYING with Momo-1...

Momo: Earb, where is Momo Unit 01?

Earb: Since this is the land of memories, Momo-1 should be in the place from your memories: "Kindergarten"-mon. Unfortunately, since Kindergarten was claimed by the Potato Bonbons as part of their territory, they may have made it into farmland-mon.

Momo: Which way is Kindergarten?

Judy: This way, Momo-chan!

Clock: I despise Kindergarten! For starters, the little grains of sand in the sandboxes always get in my gears...

Judy: Shut up, old man!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Well, what are we waiting for, guys?

## Potato Field (Chapter 4)

Momo: Momo-1! Ummm, excuse meee, I'm sorry, but I just accidentally left something around here, and, I've come back to get it now, so...!

Unit 01: Momo-chan, you shouldn't have come here-wak! This is the Potato Bonbons' turf. One wrong step in this potato field, and you'll get blown to smithereens by a potatobomb-wak!

Bonbon: Heyyyy, what's up, losers! Time's a-wasting-bon! Heh heh hehhhh, you're gonna get it, pig-butts. The way back is right over here, bahahahhaa!

Clock: They are correct, there is no time! We simply do not have time to face off against these nincompoops! Now who wants to be saved by this Clock!?

Momo: Ah! Wait, Mr. Clock!

Clock: *Steps on bomb, explodes*

Momo: Mr. Clock!

Bonbon: Bahahahahaaaaa! You got it good-bonbon! You dingleberries are stuck with us now, bahahabahaaaaa! Say, who wants to challenge us next-bon? Momochaaan?

Momo: What do we do now...

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: .... What, Barley?

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Barley, what are you trying to say?

Barley: *wan wan wan!*

Judy: Could Barley be saying that he can sniff out the bombs?

Earb: That's right-mon! Barley is saying exactly that!

Momo: Barley, we're counting on you. Guide us to Momo-1 safely, please!

Barley: *wan!*

## Game: Potato Bonbonberman

Shall we explain how to play?

- 👉Yes! explain
- I know, I'm good

Barley is able to find the potatobombs by smell. Move Barley to Momo-1 without making him step on any bombs. Use the D-pad to move Barley. If there are any bombs, Barley will find them on his own. If you step on any, they'll explode, so be careful.

[Notes: There are also holes to investigate. Walking over a hole will not cause you to fall or anything.]

Momo: Barley, please! Give it another go! Rescue Momo-1!

## Potato Field Continued

Momo: Yatttaaaaaa! Awesome, Barley!!!

Momo: I'm sorry, Momo-1, for leaving you...

Unit 01: It's all right, Momo-chan. Thank you for saving me!

Bonbon: Damn! Damn! No fair borrowing Prince Pup's powers, that's cheating!

Momo: Barley is one of us, there's nothing "unfair" about it! He's our friend!

Bonbon: You're friends with a dog? That's messed up-bon. Help me out here, bro.

Bonbon: Sure, bro. Prince Pup? More like a servant. A pathetic stray mutt-bon.

Earb: That's h-horrible...

Momo: You guys! What do you think you're saying?!

Bonbon: He's just telling it like it is-bon.

Momo: ENOUGH!!! Barley is our very, very dear friend!

Momo: *kicks bonbons into space*

Bonbon: Craaaaaaap- We won't forget this-bonnnnnnnnnn....

Momo: Barley, you ARE our friend.

Judy: Momo-chan! Which of us is your best friend, me or Barley!?

Momo: Eh? Eh?

Judy: Which is your best friend!? You have to pick!

Momo: Which is best? You can't be compared like that.

Judy: No way, no way!! You and me have been together SO much longer than Barley!

Momo: Judy....

Earb: Judy, stop being jealous-mon.

Judy: Hey!

Earb: More importantly, Momo-chan, without Mr. Clock, you can't go back home-mon... what are you going to do?

Momo: Yeah...... But my grandpa is somewhere in this world, right? Grandpa's hobby was tinkering with mechanical stuff! I think he could definitely fix Mr. Clock for us!

Momo: What is it, Barley? There's no more bombs, you don't have to keep sniffing for them.

Barley: *digs* *wan wan!*

Earb: I wonder if he's saying there's something here?

Judy: Kyaaah! A bomb?!

Momo: Eeee!!!

Judy: What? Is that a backpack?

Momo: Ah... this backpack...!

Unit 01: That's right, it's the backpack you used in Kindergarten.

Momo: But, the shoulder strap broke, and I couldn't use it any more. Ahh, that's right... when I put something in it I'd call it my magic bag...

Earb: Well, then this is a REAL magic bag-mon! The things you believed in are all true here, you see-mon?

Momo: For real? It's really a magic bag??

Momo: Whaaa, cool! I can even put it in my pocket like this! I'll carry you, Mr. clock.

Momo: *puts clock in the bag*

Unit 01: Anyway, Momo-chan, are you ready to cross over Mt. Elementary-wak?

Momo: Momo-1, can you really fly?

Unit 01: Of course I can-wak! You said so every time you sat on my back-wak! "Take to the sky, Momo-1!" you'd say.

Momo: That's right, I had completely forgotten...

Unit 01: When you forgot, that was the moment I stopped being able to fly...wak... And that's how the potato guys managed to capture me...

Momo: Oh... I'm sorry.

Unit 01: But I'm okay now! You remembered, so now I can fly freely-wak!

Momo: All right, everyone! Let's go find Grandpa! On Momo Unit 01!

Momo: Oh, what should we do about Barley?

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Is there any way... in this world, could Barley fly, I wonder?

Unit 01: It's okay-wak, Momo-chan. As long as he's by me, with those big ears, he can surely fly!

*UNIT 01 TRANSFORM!*

Momo: Whaaa! This is incredible! Barley, you really can fly!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Barley, I wonder why you can't talk like everyone else?

Judy: It's gotta be because Barley isn't your REAL friend yet. You've been talking to ME for 10 years already!

Momo: Ugh, enough, Judy! Change up your attitude or you're gonna get a tickling!

Judy: Poop.

Momo: But, it would sure be nice if you could talk like everyone else, Barley.

Barley: *whimper*

Judy: Hey, how'd you like to get a better look at the scenery?

Earb: Stooop. It's scary-mon...

Judy: Lookie, lookie!

Earb: Stopitstopitstopit-mon! Quit it, Judyyyy, quit itttt!

Momo: HEY! JUDY! It's tickle time!

Judy: Kyaaa, Momo-chan, forgive me! Don't tickle- ahahahahahahaha!

Judy: You know I can't t- take ithahaha! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Momo: Say you're going to change your attitude, say it!

Judy: Kyahaha, I promise! Nyahaha, forgive me, Momo-chan! Heehee!

Unit 01: Wak wak! Momo-chan, we crossed over Mt. Elementary-wak!

Momo: Yatta!

Momo: Let's fly just like this to the forest where Grandpa is!

Momo: Don't worry, Mr. Clock, if anyone can fix you, it's Grandpa!

Judy: Wait a second!! Momo-chan!! Before we get to the forest, isn't there... Lemon Hill...?

Momo: Oh, okay.... is something wrong with that?

Earb: It's terrible! That's where the Miracle Lemons are!

Unit 01: Oh, Momo-chan, I'm no good with the Miracle Lemons... just ONE of their acid slice attacks and folks like me go rusty instantly-wak!

Momo: Why? So maybe we should just keep flying? After all, we just flew over a huge mountain!

Unit 01: There's crazy strong wind currents above Lemon Hill, we simply can't cross it by flying-wak!

Earb: I hate sour stuff-mon. It stings my eye-eyes-mon.

Judy: Lemon facials are to blame for this blotch on my skin! Those lemons are the only thing I can't stand!

Momo: I guess there's no alternative... let's go in for a landing.

## Lemon Hill

Momo: What should we do... Since you all have problems with the Lemons...

Momo: Looks like there's no other way, should Barley and I go ahead?

Judy: Nonono! Judy will go too! We can't get separated!

Earb: Judy, don't be selfish-mon.

Unit 01: Quaaaack! Momo-chan, the backpack! The magic bag-wak!

Momo: Eh?? You mean the backpack Barley just dug up?

Unit 01: Quack-quack-that's-right. Everyone, we can go in there together-wak!

Momo: Even when the backpack is this small?

Momo: Ah!!

Unit 01: Wak! All right everyone!

Unit 01: We hop inside, and Momo-chan can bring us along-wak.

Momo: About that... how exactly will everyone fit inside this bag...

Momo: You guys?... Could they really all be in the bag?

Judy: I'm sorry I can't help...

Unit 01: Wak... Momo-chan, sorry I can't be of service...

Unit 01: But we'll be cheering you on, wak wak!

Earb: I think the Lemons will definitely know where your Grandpa lives. Momochan, good luck!

Momo: Well, Barley, it's down to just you and me now...

Barley: *wan! wan! wan!*

Momo: Thanks for the encouragement! Okay, Barley, let's do this!

## Lemon Hill Crossroads (Chapter 5)

Momo: We've arrived...

Barley: *whimper*

Momo: I've got a bad feeling about this place, somehow...

Voice: YOU TWO!

Lemon: What on earth are YOU doing hereeeeeeee?

Momo: We're trying to meet up with my grandpa, so we're crossing through.

Lemon: HO-ho-ho-ho-ho! No person shall pass, no matter who they beeeeee!

Momo: Look, I don't need a permission slip from you, we're crossing!

Lemon: Such libelous slander about us, we shall not toleraaaaateeeeee!

Lemon: You will NEVER be allowed to paaaaaaass!

Lemon: Even were you to try the impossible and pass, it would go a little something like thiiiiiiiiis!

Lemon: Give it to them, little sis!

Lemon: OK, sister!

Lemons: S-O-U-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!!!!!

## Game: Dance Dance Lemonlution

Shall we explain how to play?

- 👉Yes! explain
- I know, I'm good

The Miracle Lemons are going to throw their *Souuuuuuuur Lemon Slice* at you. You can't let it hit you, so you must avoid contact with it. Press the D-pad down to duck, and up to... jump! Avoid contact with the lemon slices in this fashion. When the Lemons tire out, that's your chance to attack! Use the A button and hit them with a rock! Momochan, be careful of being hit by the Lemon Slice's sourness!

Lemon: First you'll have to get through meeeee!

Lemon: Let's.... Suuu-peeeer-soooourrr!

Lemon: *pant... pant...* Just... a little breather...

### After defeating little Miracle Lemon

Lemon: Keeehhhhhh.... in-fu-ri-a-tinnnnnng. Big sis, h-e-l-p-m-e-eeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

Lemon: How dare you! My sister! I won't go easy on you... prepare yourself!

### After defeating big Miracle Lemon

Lemon: Keeehhhhhh.... in-fu-ri-a-tinnnnnng. Maddening! Exasperating! Infuriatiiiiiing!

### If you fail

Lemon: Ohhhhh-hohohohohohoho! How do you like it SOURRRRR?

Momo: Noooo... so soooouuurr!! My eyes!!!

Barley: *whimper*

Lemon: You two are no match for us at all! Ohohohohohoho...... Try again!!!

Barley: *whimper*

Momo: Owwwwowowoww... Barley, are you okay?

Momo: Phew, you seem all right!

Momo: All riiiight, Miracle Lemons! I won't lose this time!!

## Lemon Hill Continued

Momo: Yattaaaaa!!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Lemon: Kyuu...

Momo: Like I was saying, do you know where my grandpa lives? Tell me, and I'll help you out from under that pile of lemons.

Lemon: There is NOTHING that escapes our knowledge, is there, sis?

Lemon: Quite right, sister. There is not a thing we don't know.

Momo: Really!? Well then, WHERE is my Grandpa living!?

Lemon: I won't tell youuuuuuu!

Momo: Humph! I see, so that's your not-very-cute answer, then?

Lemon: Your threats are nothing! Nothing, nothing, nothinnnng!

Lemon: What you don't know is that we still have very, veeeeery powerful friends!

Lemon: Masterrr, Masterrr, we beg you!

Voice: As you called, here I am, your comrade!

Voice: Oh! Comrades! What on earth happened here?

Lemon: That girl BULLIED uuuuuuuuus!

Lemon: That's right. We were just playing when that girl and her little Prince Pup jumped us out of nowhere!

Lemon: I was scared, sooo sooo scared....

Voice: Hnnnnnnggg, you! To think this bad girl would cast such an evil eye upon my comrades!

Lemon: Master! You tell her, just like that! Tell her off!

Momo: Wait a minute, listen to me! It's the Lemons who arae the bad ones!

Momo: I was just trying to get to my Grandpa's house...

Voice: Silence! Don't give me excuses, is that how your mother taught you?

Voice: Huh! Wait!.... It's you....!!

Momo: Huh? What...?

Voice: Momo... Momo-chan!!

Momo: ....? How do you know my name?

Voice: It's me! Gunbot!

Lemon: M-master!?

Gunbot: This person is my second commander!

Lemon: WHAT!!! Wh- What in the?!

Gunbot: Attention, Lemons! I am categorically unable to defy my commander, for I am THE CONSUMMATE warrior. So! You will immediately relay the location of Momo-chan's grandfather!

Lemon: Uuuhh... but if we tell her, Dark Lord Cabbage is gonna yell at uuusss...

Gunbot: WHAT!! You two have been foot soldiers of Dark Lord Cabbage this whole time!?

Lemon: Sis! You've said too much, dummy!

Gunbot: YOU... You have been deceiving me all this time... Unforgivable! Those who resort to LIES can no longer be called comrades of mine!

Lemon: Uhhh-ha-ha-ha... Lying? Certainly, no, not us, preposterous!

Lemon: I- if you're looking for an old man, there's certainly an old man living at the foot of Lemon Hill!

Gunbot: How DARE the two of you try to turn me against my precious Momo-chan! How do you like THIS?!

Lemons: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah--

Gunbot: It's good to see you again, Momo-chan!

Momo: ... I'm so sorry... I still don't... remember you very well...

Gunbot: You don-... don't remember... me... Gunbot...

Momo: I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

Momo: My memories are being ransacked right now by Dark Lord Cabbage!! So... there are still bits and pieces I don't remember!

Gunbot: ...

Momo: I'm sorry! But everyone has been lending me their strength so that we can defeat Dark Lord Cabbage.

Gunbot: Dark Lord Cabbage... he's been terrorizing everyone...

Gunbot: But... it's a shock... not being remembered by your second commander...

Momo: Um... second commander? If you told me a little more of that story, I might remember...

Gunbot: ... My first commander was a boy named Gun-chan.

Gunbot: Gun-chan bestowed on me the honor of the highest regard among all of his toys.

Momo: Gun-chan...? Umm.... Umm....

Gunbot: When you were moving away, Gun-chan gave me to you, his close friend, to remember him by... Since then, I've thought of you as my second commander, always...

Gunbot: Goodbye, Momo-chan...!!

Momo: Ah! Wait! Please, just wait a second!

Momo: Gun-chan... Gun-chan... Umm...

Momo: Ah!!! I remember now!!

Momo: Ahhhhhh, I'm such an idiot! How could I have forgotten the time I had with Gunbot! And caused him so much anguish...

Momo: What do I do... I'm sorry... Gunbot...

Barley: *wan!*

Momo: Yeah... At least we know the whereabouts of Grandpa now.

Momo: In any case, let's go to see Grandpa!

Barley: *wan! wan!*

## Outside Grandpa's House (Chapter 6)

Momo: Could it really be grandpa's....

Earb: There might be Veggies there-mon...

Judy: We have to protect this peaceful forest from the Vegetable Corps! If we run into any, we'll drive 'em out just like that!

Momo: That's right.

Judy: Urk! Will you look at the state of that shack!?

Earb: Nooo, I'm scared-mon!

Gramps: Hello? Can I help you?

Momo: Grand... Grandpa?!

Gramps: Ohhh, is that you, Momo? It's good to see you.

Gramps: It's nice to see you, all of you.

Momo: Grandpa!!!

Gramps: You made it all this way. You must be tired.

## Grandpa's House - Interior

Momo: I never thought I'd be able to see you again, Grandpa...

Gramps: Whaat? But you can see me any time. Just reach for your memories of me, Momo, and there I'll be.

Gramps: But hey, kiddo. Take a look over here.

Captain: *wurf*

Momo: Captain! It's Captain!

Captain: Momo-chan! My sweet Momo-chan!

Captain: To believe that we meet again...!

Momo: You look happy, Captain! I'm so glad!

Momo: Ah, that's right!

Momo: Grandpa! Could you fix a clock?

Gramps: Of course! Why, is your clock broken, Momo?

Momo: Um... I'm not sure you can say that exactly...

Momo: Here it is, anyway...

Gramps: Oh dear! Wait, isn't that... Mr. Clock?

Momo: Grandpa, you know about Mr. Clock?

Gramps: Oh yes, I know him well. We met once every other month, like clockwork.

Judy: Oh! So it was you who did Mr. Clock's constant inspections!

Gramps: Ah, right you are. 

Gramps: His gatekeeper duties were one thing, that can't be helped. But Mr. Clock must have spent a lot of time thinking about how to get to you.

Gramps: I wonder if it might have driven him a little cuckoo sometimes.

Momo: Aha.

Gramps: That oughta've done it!

Momo: ?? Huh? Mr. Clock!

Gramps: ?? That's strange... He's only got the one winding key, did I forget to reattach it?

Momo: MR. CLOCK!

Clock: Nmm??? Y-----yaaaaaaaawn... I'm up...

Clock: I say, why is everybody staring at me?

Gramps: Mister, you were broken, and everyone was worried sick about you is why.

Barley: *wan!*

Gramps: Oh, well if you aren't a cute one. Momo, what's this little guy's name?

Momo: This is Barley! He's my new best friend!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Gramps: Ahh? So it's Barley?

Gramps: Look, I've got some cheese, do you want it?

Gramps: Haha! Is that good? Huh? One more? All right, all right.

Momo: Grandpa? Everyone else can talk, how come Barley is the only one who can't talk?

Gramps: Momo, words aren't the only way to understand someone's feelings, you know.

Gramps: Ohhh, really? I see.

Gramps: So you love cheese, Barley.

Momo: Could it... Can you understand Barley's words, Grandpa?

Gramps: Oh, I understand. But we aren't speaking with words, you know.

Gramps: It's communication of the heart. Captain's words, and Barley's words, this old heart can hear alllll of them. Isn't that right, Barley?

Barley: *wan!*

Gramps: "Cheese tastes good," he says, hoh!

Momo: Why? Why? I want so badly to communicate with Barley, why can't I seem to understand?

Gramps: Momo, you mustn't rush it.

Gramps: Try and listen closely to your heart.

Gramps: If you truly want to understand Barley, your heart must be open.

Gramps: Sloooowly, take your time.

Judy: Momo's grandpa! Listen, because of Dark Lord Cabbage, the World of Memories is in peril!

Earb: That's right-mon. Dark Lord Cabbage is erasing all the memories-mon!

Gramps: Is that so?... Well, I'd like to help... It's terrible, but, I'm afraid I can't...

Judy: WHY!?

Gramps: I have my own memories that I have to protect. You understand, Momo, don't you?

Momo: Uh-huh!

Gramps: But, I can give you this, Momo.

Momo: This is...?

Gramps: Have you forgotten already?

Gramps: Long ago, your Papa gave you this as a Christmas present.

Momo: That's right... Papa said this bracelet can make three wishes come true!

Momo: But, when I found out Papa was Santa Claus, I thought that must have been made up too...

Gramps: Now do you think it could make your wishes come true?

Momo: Ummm... Now...

Judy: Hey, Momo-chan, wish to know where Dark Lord Cabbage is!

Momo: Yes, let's try it!

Momo: Tell me! Dark Lord Cabbage, WHERE is he?!

Gramps: Momo, in this world, there is nothing that can overcome Dark Lord Cabbage's magical powers.

Gramps: So, I'm sorry but the Flower Bracelet can't make that wish come true.

Momo: What! Then what's the point?

Gramps: Don't panic, don't panic, Momo. Don't you think there's another way to learn the location of Dark Lord Cabbage?

Unit 01: Quack! Momo-chan! I remember-wak!!!

Unit 01: The Potato Bonbons said something about the Hallo-Pumpkin knowing-wak.

Momo: Oh? So, let's start by looking for the Pumpkin!

Momo: Flower Bracelet, where is the Hallo-Pumpkin?!

Earb: Nooooo! Picture-Book Forest was so pretty, I can't believe it's gone black and white-mon!

Clock: Surely, this is the doing of Hallo-Pumpkin!

Judy: We've gotta beat that Pumpkin and save the picture books!

Clock: Picture-Book Forest is just beyond here, let us go!

Momo: Yeah, let's go!

Captain: Gramps... I... I...

Grampa: You don't have to worry about me, Captain.

Grampa: You want to help Momo?

Grampa: Yessir, you had best go with 'em.

Captain: *wufh!*

Momo: Captain.... You'll really come with us?

Momo: But... Captain, you're old, you really don't have to trouble yourself...

Captain: Momo-chan...　please take me with you.

Captain: I'll protect you, Momo-chan, now...

Captain: It's... it's my duty.

Momo: ...Thank you.

Momo: You were always by my side, Captain...

Momo: I'm truly happy...

Barley: *wan!*

Momo: ? What is it, Barley?

Barley: *wan! wan!*

Momo: Barley, what is it? Are you trying to tell us something?

Gramps: Momo, don't rely on words. Look closely at Barley. Clear your heart.

Momo: Yes.

Barley: Barley...

Barley: Barley will...

Barley: fight with

Barley: Momo-chan

Momo: Barley!! Thank you!

Grandpa: Momo...

Momo: ...?

Gramps: Please take good care of my friend who took care of me.

Gramps: And, be a good child, one who is kind and understands the hearts of everyone around her.

Momo: I will. Grandpa, will I get to meet you again?

Gramps: Of course. Just remember me, anytime, ok?

Gramps: Well, take good care, everyone. Good luck!

Momo: Okay! Here we gooooo!

Gramps: ...Please be careful... Momo...

Momo: All right, you promised! Tell us where to find Dark Lord Cabbage.

Pumpkin: Yes, yes, let me hand you a map.

Pumpkin: I'll have Petite Pumpkin bring it.

Judy: We did it!

P.Pumpkin: Hallo-hallo-hallo- P U M P K I N!

P.Pumpkin: Oh-pe-kepe-pon, pe-poPOONNNN!!

Momo: What the?!

P.Pumpkin: Kera-kera-keheheheh! Caughtcha! Caughtcha!

P.Pumpkin: GA-GA-GOTCHA, PIG-BUTTS!

Momo: It's a trap!

Pumpkin: Kehehehe. Only idiots fall for that! With you troublesome pains in the gourd out of the way, these picture books won't have main characters... they won't even have a single supporting role!

## Book 1: Snow White

Momo: Huh!? Where are we?

Clock: It would appear that somehow, we have been dropped into the middle of a picture book...

Earb: Who... Who's over there-mon!?

A long time ago, in a far-off land, there was an astonishingly beautiful princess by the name of Snow White. This princess was so beautiful that each day, she would get carried away and do just as she pleased.

Snow White: Ohhh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Are you saying that you're not listening to what I'm saying?

Even the Prince on the White Horse, despite his betrothal to Snow White, was so thoroughly intimidated by her beauty that he gave not the slightest indication of proposing. Snow White was bored by this, and a little annoyed. And so, haughty from dawn 'til dusk, she indulged her every selfish desire.

Momo: What the... was Snow White really this kind of story?

Judy: No way! Pumpkin kidnapped the Prince so he could make this mega-messed-up version of the story!

Snow White's selfishness got worse as the days went by, until one day, the Queen expelled her from the castle.

Queen: For your intolerable selfishness, I hereby banish you to the hill in the forest!

Queen: Until you can change your heart, and become a kind and good child, you may never leave this forest!

Snow White: Uwaaaaaagh!!

The now-banished Snow White was carried out by the kingdom's soldiers and deserted in the middle of the forest. Chucked.

Snow White: ShhhHHiiiiiIIIit! What am I supposed do in this godforsaken place, anyway?

Snow White exploded in anger, over and over again, at the trees all around her.

Momo: Snow White would never take out her aggresion on trees!

Before long, Snow White ran out of steam, and her anger gave way to hunger. She slowly began looking about the forest for something to eat.

Just then, Snow White heard the sound of song emerging from the hill in the forest. The singing voices belonged to none other than the Seven Dwarves.

Momo: Okay, now this is starting to sound like the Snow White I know!

When Snow White heard the voices singing, she hiked up the hem of her skirt and took off, legs akimbo, in a somewhat unladylike manner.

She ran, and when she neared that house, from which the sounds of song could be heard, Snow White only increased her speed, and barreled inside.

Snow White: HELLOOO! How are y'all doin??!

Dwarf: Huh?

The Seven Dwarves were doing their work inside that little house. When Snow White suddenly appeared, they stared at her with faces blank from shock.

Snow White: All y'all want to get in my good graces, mmhmm? You heard that right, the ravishing princess you see before you, ME!

The Seven Dwarves, despite their initial shock, saw that she was indeed gorgeous, and were soon head over heels for her.

Snow White: Ho-ho-ho! Well then, you can start by digging up some precious jewels for ME!

Dwarf: Yes, Princess Snow White!

Momo: W- wait a minute. In this, Snow White is just some mega-bitch?

Judy: But wouldn't it be nice, to be so beautiful everyone falls madly in love with you...

Snow White: Ohohohohoho!!! Y'all are my SLAVES!

The Seven Dwarves were miners whose job was to excavate precious gems from the mountain. Snow White, by enslaving them, became filthy rich in the blink of an eye.

Snow White: Heh heh heh heh heh. There's nothing for me to be afraid of! I'll defeat the Queen and the whole country will be mine! Ohhhh ho ho ho ho ho ho hoh!

Momo: ...what in the...

Judy: Truly, the kind of villain who will be totally destroyed by the side of justice.

The Queen, learning that the Snow White she once banished was well on her way to becoming an evil queen, was thoroughly shocked. "I must do something about this," she thought, and a plan began to take shape.

The next day, disguised as an old hag, the Queen set out for the forest.

Queen: I come bearing a gift for the beautiful Snow White.

Snow White: Hohoho. A present for me?

Queen: Just so, I bring you this enchanted apple. Very good for your figure, very good for losing weight.

Snow White: What? So, you're saying it can make me even MORE beautiful?

Queen: Just so. Such beauty that would turn the heads of the very angels in heaven! That is what the apple that you hold in your hand can give you.

Snow White: And what do you call this apple?

Queen: Just so, it is known as the "Operation Paradise" apple.

Snow White: You don't say? Well, I thank you!

Queen: Hahaaa...

The enemy's operation had cunningly ensnared Snow White. If you ate it this apple, I don't know about becoming beautiful, but the angels in heaven would in fact turn towards you, for it was a poison apple! Without hesitation, Snow White took a huge bite of the apple. The poison hit her and before she could take another bite, Snow White was dead.

And thus it was that the evil princess Snow White went to heaven... And everyone else lived happily ever after.

Judy: Huh, the last part did kinda seem like Snow White, but...

Momo: NONE of that was ANYTHING like Snow White! Couldn't it at least have had a happy ending? And the prince never even showed up!

Unit 01: Besides, how are we supposed to get out from this picture book?

Clock: Logically, by reading it through to the end, no doubt. Therefore, I had thought that turning to the final page would release us, but it would not seem to be the case.

Unit 01: What if, like a real fairy tale, we have to give Snow White a happy ending?

Clock: That must be it! So, even if by our hand, the tale concludes with a true happy ending, we will be able to leave?

Momo: That's right, that has to be right!

Momo: Ah, but, Snow White's ending...

Judy: The Prince wakes up Snow White with a kiss!

Unit 01: But the Prince was nowhere to be found-wak...

Momo: What to do...

Judy: Momo-chan, this is for all of us! You're going to have to shed your own skin.

Momo: Eeeeh!! W- wait, what the?!

The Seven Dwarves, wailing with sadness, surrounded Snow White's body with flowers. As they did so, the up-until-now nowhere-to-be-found prince, appeared on a tricycle with two dogs, a bear and a doll.

Momo: But I'm not a boyyy!

Judy: There, there, it's okay...

The Seven Dwarves turned to the Prince, and through their tears, informed him that he was one step behind, and Snow White is now deceased.

Glancing mournfully at their faces, the Prince entered the Dwarves' house. He sat at the bed where Snow White lay with a tranquil face, softly drew near to her cold but full lips, and lightly...

Momo: Eeeeh! What's this?! No way... No way!!

Judy: C'mon, Momo-chan, do it! Do it!

Momo: Just wait a second! I'm a GIRL!

Judy: There, there, it's okay...

Momo: Wahhhhh! My first kiss is going to be with a GIRL? Nooo....

The Prince lightly kissed Snow White's lips.

Momo: It's... all...

Snow White: Yeeeesss, girllll!

Momo: too... fast...

Thanks to the appearance of a gentle Prince on his White Horse, Snow White's evil ambitions disappeared, and the two of them lived a happy life together in the forest.

And they all lived happily ever after.

Unit 01: We're... still in the book-wak.

Momo: *sniff*...

Clock: Well, now, there was no avoiding that place...

Momo: I'm trying to keep it together...

## Book 2: Cinderella

Long ago in a faraway land, there lived two cruel sisters, along with a mother yet ten times more unkind.

The only thing that exceeded the cruelty of these three was their pride. Certain, they were, that only they were fit to wed the prince of this kingdom.

Momo: Hey, this book sounds like Cinderella, but... there's no Cinderella?

Judy: This has got to be Pumpkin's doing!

Soon, a ball was to be held at the castle, where it was announced that the prince would choose his princess.

The three, hearing this, could only scream in delight. Straightaway they began channeling their fortune into playing dress-up.

Dresses of silk, adornments of peacock feathers, and so on, and so on, they ordered the rarest finery from every corner of the globe to dress up in.

On the night of the ball, the sisters and mother put on the dresses they had made for this day and headed to the castle. Their entrance at the ball, naturally, was eye-turning. Nevertheless, the three failed to win the favor of the prince.

Finally, the ball concluded, without the prince having found his perfect match.

Momo: Hold up... what happens now?!

Prince: Already the bell has rung out midnight at this ball... Wasn't my perfect match going to drop a shoe on the way out?

Just as the prince turned toward the moon, muttering these desolate words, a sound emerged from the direction of the garden.

Prince: Could it be?!

The prince sped off in the direction of the garden.

Momo: Ah! It must be Cinderella. Finally, she made her entrance.

In the castle garden, a handsome servant boy had fallen down, his foot caught in the roots of a tree. Right before the prince's eyes, there was his one foot, missing a shoe.

Prince: No way...

His hands shaking with deep emotion, the prince uttered softly.

Prince: My perfect match, it was you this whole time!

Momo: Happening... again...!

Judy: Waiiit!

And so it was that the prince and his handsome servant boy lived together in happiness.

And so it was that the cruel mother and daughters who lived in town, having spent their entire fortune on dresses, sank into wretched poverty.

Momo: Just hold up! If we end it like that, that's not the romantic, yearning prince at all!

Judy: And what about our honor as girls?!

Momo: Cinderella and Snow White, their princes are supposed to be a girl's dream, an ideal!

Momo: These princes are DESPICABLE!

Judy: So, what are you gonna do about it, Momo-chan?

Momo: Turn back the page! I'll do Cinderella this time!

Long ago in a faraway land, there lived a girl with a kind heart named Cinderella.

The girl's father had died young, and she lived with two cruel stepsisters, along with a stepmother yet ten times more unkind.

The only thing that exceeded the cruelty of these three was their pride. Certain, they were, that only they were fit to wed the prince of this kingdom.

Stepmom: Here, Cinderella, clean our rooms immediately!

Today too, the cruel sisters foisted work on Cinderella. However...

Momo: What am I cleaning their rooms for? It's their room, they should clean it up!

Cinderella was extremely strong, and she stood up to her sisters who were always cruel, and defied their bullying.

Judy: Momo-chan, wasn't Cinderella bullied a lot? Somehow this is different than "Cinderella" too...

Momo: There, there, it's okay... Everything's fine so long as I get a happy ending.

Judy: Oh? Then, maybe you can let Judy do as she likes?

Soon, a ball was to be held at the castle, where it was announced that the prince would choose his princess.

The sisters and mother, hearing this, used every penny of their fortune to make an extravagantly beautiful dress.

But, the dress was not for Cinderella.

Momo: What about my dress?

Stepmom: But Cinderella, you have no need for a dress!

Cinderella's stepmother, caked in heavy makeup and squeezed into the dress, violently reprimanded her.

Momo: Isn't it this exact kind of mother who doesn't deserve a dress?! Are you forgetting your age? Won't they say you're kidnapping the young prince?

Stepmom: BANG!

Hitting the nail on the head, and having been so completely roasted, the stepmother broke out in a cold sweat. 

Momo: Hey lady, you look like a ghost with all that makeup on. Hey Ms. Ghost, you really think the prince is gonna fall for a ghost?

Momo: Yo, have you even seen your face in a mirror?

The stepmother made a face like a toad.

Stepmom: That... you...

Momo: Gimme that dress!

Momo: I'm confident I can win the prince's heart, at least more than you!

Stepmom: Shut up! Shut up shut up shut up!

Stepmom: Cinderella, I forbid you to attend the ball! It's settled, it's a matter of law!

Momo: What law?!

Cinderella and her stepmother began to spar, and at that moment, a door opened and a cute little fairy appeared.

Momo: Judy!

Judy: Eheheh. Judy wanted to come play in the story too.

Laughing haughtily, the fairy snapped her finger toward Cinderella!

Judy: Ohhhh ho ho ho ho ho! Cinderella, quit this ugly behavior.

Momo: Wh- what? Ugly?

Judy: Well...

Stepmom: Yeah. Yeah! You're ugly!

The two stepsisters and stepmother, agreeing with the suddenly-appeared fairy, said nothing to contradict her.

But, with a grimace, the fairy turned to face the three women and said:

Judy: But you, you are even more ugly. You're the embodiment of ugliness.

Sis: Gurk!!

Judy: Cinderella, instead of that cheap-looking thing, let me use my magic to present you with a brand-new dress. Wear it, and you'll win the prince's heart for sure!

Momo: Okay! Who will steal the prince's heart? It's on!

Stepmom: Big words from a low-class girl! I'll accept your challenge!

And so, the castle's ballroom is set as the venue where the princess shall be chosen, the ring of the showdown between Cinderella and her stepmother.

On the night of the ball, the sisters and mother put on the dresses they had made for this day and headed to the castle. Their entrance at the ball, naturally, was eye-turning.

Stepmother: Ho ho ho ho ho ho! My naive young Cinderella, don't you realize it's my mature sex appeal that will win?

Nevertheless, the three failed to win the favor of the prince.

Stepmother: Whaaaaat!?

Indeed, Cinderella made even more of an eye-turning entrance. Cinderella took up the central balcony at the heart of the ballroom and the whole ballroom went stark raving mad over her.

The prince's heart was taken away by this radiant figure of Cinderella. He approached and gave Cinderella his proposal.

Prince: You are my star, my moon, my sun. The world itself would become dark if you were not in it! Therefore, I beg you, please marry me.

Momo: You know, is there any special need to lose my shoe and run away here?

Judy: I don't see any particular reason to, no!

Momo: Well, I guess I can give you my answer then!

At the prince's confession of love, Cinderella, cheeks blushing red, nodded.

Momo: "Yes."

At the castle, a magnificent show of fireworks was launched to celebrate the prince choosing his princess. Without skipping a beat, the ball rolled into a great celebration. 

And they all lived happily ever after.

Judy: Although the scene where she loses her shoe at midnight is missing... Kinda doesn't feel like Cinderella, does it?

Momo: It'll do for now! We didn't have a choice, anyway.

## Book 3: Little Red Riding Hood

Momo: What's next?

Judy: Okay, if there's a wolf here, you have to think Little Red Riding Hood.

Long ago, in a forest, there lived a wolf. The wolf was always, always hungry, but there was never enough food to go around.

Momo: Let me guess, it's cause of Pumpkin that Red Riding Hood isn't here?

Judy: Yeahhh... Since the main character is missing, it's for sure.

Finally, the wolf got so hungry he died.

An old lady also lived alone in the forest. The old woman fell ill, but there was nobody to come and visit her. So the old lady died too.

Momo: Uhhh... WHAT?!

And they lived happily ever after.

Momo: Who did?! What part of that is happy?!

Captain: Momo-chan, seems like you need to become Little Red Riding Hood first.

Momo: Yeah. Turn back the page!

Long ago, there was a girl who was known for her red kerchief as Little Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood had a grandmother who lived alone in the forest. But the old woman had fallen ill. So, accompanied by a big dog, a tricycle, a little girl, and a stuffed bear, she set off to visit her poor granny.

Judy: Huh? Barley's not here.

Momo: No, he's in the basket. He has to defeat the wolf later on.

Judy: Oh!

In the forest there also lived a wolf, who was always, always hungry. Red Riding Hood's party fascinated his eye, and he devised a plan to eat them up at the first opportunity. So, he went ahead of them and headed towards granny's cottage.

The wolf, arriving at granny's cottage, thought he would eat up grandma first.

Wolf: Hmmm, although, any minute now the much tastier looking Red Riding Hood should be arriving. I'll drop it with granny, and hold onto that hunger just a little longer!

The wolf chucked granny inside the shed, and, posing as her grandma, laid in wait for Red Riding Hood. Before long, Little Red Riding Hood appeared.

Momo: Anyone home?

The wolf, licking his lips, replied.

Wolf: Who's there? *cough cough*

Momo: Granny, it's me! Little Red Riding Hood!

Wolf: Ooohhh, you made it! *cough cough* Well, come in, come in.

Momo: Okaayy!

The wolf, cloaking himself in sheets up to his eyes, waited for his opportunity. But, with her companions keeping watch, there was no chance for him to swoop in.

Momo: Granny, I've come to pay you a visit!

Wolf: Ooohhh, why thank you!

Momo: Oh!

Momo: Granny, your voice, it's become so hoarse, just like a wolf's!

Wolf: Urk!!

Red Riding Hood's words, so suddenly hitting the nail on the head, turned the wolf pale.

Wolf: That's b- because I caught a cold...

Momo: Uh-huh.

Momo: Oh!

Momo: Granny, your ears, they're huge and pointy, just like a wolf's!

Wolf: Ufkrf-gfhh!?

Red Riding Hood's words, hitting the nail on the head for the second time, made the wolf turn even paler, and he began to tremble.

Wolf: Th- th- th- that's so I can h- hear your voice well...

Momo: That's so weird, I didn't know a human's ears could just... become bigger. Can they?

Wolf: S-... Uh, sometimes they do!

Wolf: Uh, l- like, you know, l- like, a sp-.. a spon- a spontaneous mutation. Yeah... yeah!

Momo: Ohhhh, is that right.

Momo: Oh!

Momo: Granny, your mouth, it's huge, like a wolf's!

Momo: Looks like it could eat me in a single bite!

Wolf: Ungkrkdhhtfthp!!!

More and more, Red Riding Hood's words turned the wolf completely white as a sheet, and his breath appeared to become faint.

Wolf: T- That's... You...

Momo: So close. For a heinous, evil wolf to deceive and eat up a cute innocent girl.

Wolf: Y- you, have to be careful of that...

Wolf: Cause you... really are... cute...

At the wolf's words, Little Red Riding Hood laughed sweetly and nodded.

Momo: Yes. That's right, granny! I brought along a feast I made for you.

Momo: Look, look.

At that, the wolf thought he saw his chance. Taking advantage of Red Riding Hood's momentary distraction looking inside her basket, the wolf thought he would eat her up. But just as the flap of the basket opened, a small dog flew out. Biting at the wolf's gaping jaw, the puppy defeated the wolf.

Wolf: Waaaah! I give up, I give upppp!

Momo: Yatta!!!

Little Red Riding Hood helped out her grandmother from inside the little shed. She handed over the wolf to an old hunter who was passing by the cottage, and brought peace to the forest for once and for all.

And they lived happily ever after.

Momo: Hey, the fog's lifted! Maybe now we can finally get out of this picture book??

Clock: There's no helping it. Momo-chan, what do you think about borrowing the power of your Flower Bracelet?

Judy: That's right! We probably should have realized that a little earlier...

Unit 01: Momo-chan, please!

Momo: Ok. FLOWER BRACELET!

Momo: I wish... we were taken out of this picture book!

## Picture-Book Forest Continued

Barley: *woof woof woof woof woof woof!*

Captain: *WURF WURF!*

Pumpkin: AIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Pumpkin: How did you get out of there!?

Pumpkin: There were still 279 books left!

Pumpkin: You weren't supposed to be able to get out yettt!!

Momo: There'll be no forgiveness for you!

Judy: Captain, do it!

Captain: *grrrr* *WOOF!*

Pumpkin: Ahahahahaha....

Judy: We're raging out! If we find you, I think we'll smash you into a fine powder!

Momo: Okay everyone, ready?

Pumpkin: Zozoooooo~!

Momo: You can't trick us any more! Now return this forest to how you found it!

Pumpkin: I get it! I get itttt! Jeez! *shlorp*

Momo: And there's the matter of the characters you kidnapped from those books.

Pumpkin: About that...

Clock: Return them immediately!

Barley: *grrrrr*

Pumpkin: Eheheh, they're all in a cabbage patch near us!

Momo: After all that, you're trying to trick us again? Looks like this guy hasn't learned his lesson, everyone! Get ready to smash him up!

Captain: *wurf wurf wurf wurf!*

Pumpkin: I'm not lying any more! I swear, I'm tellin ya the truth...

Momo: Fine. Then next you can tell us about the Dark Lord Cabbage's hiding place.

Momo: Where is it?!

Pumpkin: It, it's...

Judy: Spit it out!

Pumpkin: If it gets out that I talked, they'll make me suffer horribly afterward!

Pumpkin: I.. I can't tell you!

Judy: You know...

Judy: You could suffer then... or... you could suffer now... 

Judy: Which-is-it-gonna-be?

Pumpkin: EEeeeeeaaagh, let me gooooo!

Pumpkin: That cabbage patch!!! There's a hint inside that cabbage over there! It's just a hint, forgive meeeeeee!

Judy: INSIDE THE CABBAGE!?

Pumpkin: Made you look, ya dumb pig butts! BYE BYE, BOING!!!!

Momo: Ahh! Wait!

## Cabbage Patch (Chapter 8)

Judy: What are THOSE??

Unit 01: Cabbages, huh...

Earb: There's something funny about those cabbages-mon.

Earb: It's almost as if their leaves are mouths-mon.

Momo: Something... feels wrong...

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: What is it, Barley?

Barley: *wan!*

Captain: He's saying there's something inside that cabbage.

Momo: Could it really be the book's characters like Pumpkin said...?

Earb: Inside the cabbage...?

Clock: At any rate, we had better help it.

Momo: Ah! Barley!

Momo: Barley, clever, clever boy!

Momo: Barley, well done!

Momo: Can your nose sniff out those main characters even in the dirt?

Barley: *wan!*

## Game: Protagonist Patch

Shall we explain how to play?

- 👉Yes! explain
- I know, I'm good

Momo-chan. Use Barley's nose to search for the heroes of the picture book! Moving Barley is just like in the potato fields, use the D-pad. Try to press the directions toward the smell of the cabbages. There are 5 heroes and heroines. Save them all before they get completely gobbled up! Good luck, Momo-chan!

[These may appear in random order]

### Peter Pan

Peter Pan: Pheeew, you saved me! Thanks! I'm Peter Pan, nice to meetcha!

Judy: Eeeee! It's Peter Pan! Judy loves that story!

Judy: Mr. Pan! Shake my hand!

Peter: Ahh, okay, okay.

Judy: Um, also, would, would you mind... signing this...?

Peter: Uhh, yeah, you know, I gotta get back to my book... but thanks!

Judy: Wh- nooo, wait up! Mr. Pan!!!

Clock: Judy, enough is enough!

Judy: Tsk! Lame.

### Bunbuku Chagama

[Bunbuku Chagama, or "Bunbuku tea-kettle" is a Japanese folktale about a raccoon that uses its shapeshifting powers to reward its rescuer for his kindness]

Bunbuku: Buhaaa! You saved me!

Earb: It looks like there's a bowl on your back-mon?

Momo: Earb, that's "Teakettle"! 

Momo: Bunbuku Teakettle Raccoon-san!

Bunbuku: Yahaaa, thank you! When I was eaten by this cabbage I didn't know what to do! Truly, thank you! Bonnnbokoooriiiiiiiin!

### Kintarou

[Kintarou, or "Golden Boy", is a hero from Japanese folklore. A child of superhuman strength, he became friendly with the animals of the mountain, and caught the demon Shuten-douji. Kintarou is often characterized with an ono, a haragake apron, and sometimes a bear.]

Momo: Are you Kintaro-san?

Kintarou: (In broken english) Yes, me is Kintarou! Thanks you for saving me! Well, bye bye!

Judy: Huh... what a weird guy...

### Puss-in-Boots

Puss: You saved meeeow! Thank you-nyan!

Judy: That cat, it's... Puss in Boots?

Captain: A cat, wearing long boots... must be the hero of that book.

Puss: Byebye-nyaaaan!

## Cabbage Patch Continued

So, Momo-chan. There's just one storybook hero left to find. Good luck!

Barley: *whimper!*

Momo: Barley!

???: Gahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haaaaa...

Momo: Show yourself!

???: Oooh, caught a tasty one, I did.

???: Gahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haaaaa...

TBC: They call me... THE BIG CABBAGE!!

TBC: You impudent fools... you are the scoundrels who dare oppose the Dark Lord Cabbage.

Momo: Give Barley back!!

TBC: Heh. And you must be the one they call Momo.

TBC: You have something to say to ME?

Momo: Give Barley back, you dumb cabbage!

TBC: WHAT! Are you sure you don't want to apologize for that?! You would dare speak such vile words against US?

Momo: What, vile? What did I say?

Momo: I can't remember...

TBC: Why you! Don't wind me up and then drop it!!!

TBC: Shit! Dark Lord Cabbage stole away all your precious memories, and now you can't remember a damn thing!

Momo: That's baloney, I can remember perfectly. I remember everything!

TBC: Gah-hahahahahahahaha! That's a joke, right? Considering all your important memories are here in Momo-land. Shouldn't they have come with you to the real world? Hmm? Don't you think?

Momo: But...

TBC: Gaaaaahh-hahahahaha! You've been so busy growing up, doing homework, games, going to school, blah blah blah, what free time do you have to sit around thinking about stuff from your past!?

TBC: Your Judy doll, his royal highness Earb, that scrap heap Gunbot, Momo-01, you forgot half of them, for crying out loud!

Momo: But... but...

TBC: The minute you return to reality, these memories will vanish without a trace, and you won't be able to recall the first thing about your friends here. No matter what, your memories are being eaten up faster and faster, vanishing, you see?

Momo: ...

TBC: And THAT is the punishment for going against Dark Lord Cabbage. And you'll never in 5.67 million years be able to strike back!

TBC: You can't change a damn thing here, so go back to Reality where you came from!

Momo: Shut up! Shut up shut up shut UP! Give Barley back to me!

TBC: Nnnbeeeeehhhhh! I've taken this thing away from you, and seems like I was wise to do so. It's quite a useful thing, wouldn't you say? It would make a perfect servant for Dark Lord Cabbage, don't you think? Eh, Prince Pup?

Captain: Let Barley go, you can take me as the servant.

Momo: Captain!

TBC: HAH! You? Aren't you a little too frail, old man? This one is a puppy yet, given enough time he'll forget all about Momo and the rest. No, I think not to this little exchange.

Judy: Give Barley BACK!

TBC: CELERY BLADE!

Judy: Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! That veggie STINKS!!!!

TBC: GAAAA-hahahahahaha!

Momo: Why... Why would you do something so horrible to me?! What does the Dark Cabbage Lord have against me!?

*They disappear*

Momo: Wait! Come back! Come back with Barley!!!

Momo: !!

Earb: Momo-chan, look out!

Earb: Owwwwwww!!

Momo: Earb!

Earb: It hurts! It hurts!!

Momo: Earb, it's my fault you got hurt...

Earb: Was I... helpful?

Momo: Earb...

Momo: Yes...! Earb, thank you!

Earb: I'll be okay-mon. So please, save Barley for me.

Momo: I understand. But Earb, you need help...

Momo: Let's get you back to Grandpa's.

Earb: I've... become a brave boy-mon! I can make it to Momo-chan's Grandpa's on my own now-mon.

Momo: Earb...

Clock: My, but you have grown up, Earb! What a splendid, honorable act!

Momo: Will you really be okay all alone?

Earb: Yeah, I'm fine-mon. *wince*

Judy: Don't overdo it... You don't have to put on a brave face...

Earb: No... Earb doesn't want to slow Momo-chan and her friends down-mon. So, I want you to save Barley, for me-mon.

Momo: What should we do... Captain, Mr. Clock...

Clock: To further waste time here would only serve to dishonor Earb's actions.

Judy: Hey, old man, still griping about the time as usual?! Although a little less loudly than usual.

Clock: That is due to the time and our circumstances. If we want to rescue Barley, there is not a minute to lose to argument.

Momo: That's right... Earb, head straight to Grandpa's, and he'll take care of that injury, okay? After that, you can wait there.

Earb: Okay! Momo-chan, please find your way back to Grandpa's cottage afterward.

Momo: Yes, I promise!

Judy: But... the cabbage that snatched Barley, and the Dark Lord Cabbage, we don't know where either of them are, right? So what are we supposed to do?

Momo: I wish... I wish for Barley back!

Momo: Why...

Unit 01: Momo-chan. The Dark Lord Cabbage's magic is stronger than your Flower Bracelet's. Your Grandpa said so, remember?

Unit 01: Somehow, that big cabbage guy can transfer things instantly, so getting Barley back from the Dark Lord Cabbage... it's not going to be that easy.

Momo: But then... what do we do?

Judy: Momo-chan, you can... forget about Judy. Go back to the real world.

Momo: ....!?

Judy: Momo-chan, we had a lot of fun. Being forgotten about... well, it's a teensy bit sad, but... well, knowing that we all have our own world here makes me kind of happy. Momo, you can go back to reality, where your mama and papa are waiting for you.

Unit 01: Quaack... We've done everything we can-wak. There's nothing left... wak... wak...

Momo: But... if I give up on you all... you'll all... all of you will...

Momo: I'll forget everything about you... and Barley...

Momo: I won't do it! I can't just forget about all of you! I can't leave Barley behind!!

Momo: And above all, I'm sorry, but I can't let down Earb, who got hurt defending me! If I turned back now, I'd be breaking the promise I made to him. I won't do it!

Judy: Momo-chan...

Momo: I don't want to lose you all! Even when I grow up, even when I'm an old lady, I don't want to forget you!

Momo: If I had been more careful, Barley would be safe... If I thought more about Barley's feelings... So... So... I alone have to be the one to rescue him! It's my fault that he got caught by the cabbage. If I don't go...

Captain: *Wurf!*

Momo: Captain... You'll come with me?

Captain: It's my duty to keep you safe.

Unit 01: Quaaaack! I got it, Momo-chan! I'll go with you-wak! I don't know what to do about Dark Lord Cabbage or any of that, but wherever you go, I'll fly along-wak-wak!

Momo: Momo-1...

Judy: Guess there's no getting out of it, Judy will come along with you too. It's not Judy's fight, but if I don't go I'll just sit up worrying what you'll do without me.

Unit 01: We'd be the ones worrying about Judy-wak!

Judy: Come here and say that! Anyway I'm only doing it for my best friend Momo. And because it's too sad to think of Barley enslaved by a cabbage.

Clock: Ooooookay! Let's go!

## Forest (Chapter 9)

Momo: Where'd they take Barley off to...

Judy: What if we asked the Flower Bracelet to take us to the Hallo-Pumpkin again?

Unit 01: No no. He's nothing but a liar, we listen to him and we'd just get tricked again. Only tricks and lies.

Judy: Well, what if we asked the location of the big cabbage?

Captain: No, it'd be a total waste. He's got to be near Dark Lord Cabbage, so his magic will protect them.

Judy: Hmm...

Momo: Hey, how about this? What if I ask the Flower Bracelet for a map of this land?

Clock: A map?

Momo: Yeah, nobody can know this place in its entirety. Since we don't have the slightest idea of where to go, with a map we'd figure it out, right? We can look for any inconspicuous places!

Judy: Momo-chan, that's great! Great!

Unit 01: That's our Momo-chan!

Momo: Ehehe! Okay, okay.

Momo: Alright! This is my wish:

Momo: I wish for a map of this land!

Momo: I wish for a map with the territory occupied by the Vegetable Corps, mountains and rivers, all marked on it!

Momo: I wish it, Flower Bracelet!

Momo: That's a strange shape... There's nothing written here, what's that about?

Unit 01: Wak wak! The Flower Bracelet's power was counteracted by that of the Dark Lord-wak!

Judy: Don't be dumb. You can see for yourself all the good hiding spots!

Captain: Hoh hoh hoh. It looks like we know where we're going.

Momo: That's right. Everyone, let's go!

## Camp

Judy: Are you up, Momo-chan?

Judy: I wonder why the Dark Lord Cabbage is doing such awful things to Momo-chan?

Momo: You know, I've thought a lot about it too. I wish I knew...

Unit 01: The cabbage guy was saying try to listening to your heart?-wak.

Judy: Nothing comes to mind?

Momo: No... Nothing...

Momo: Thing is, it's been eating me up, I can't think of what the Lord and Big cabbages have against me at all.

Momo: That, and what happened to Barley.

Momo: I wish he didn't have to go through all this...

Captain: We should all get moving first thing tomorrow. So, for now, let's get some rest.

Momo: Yeah. Goodnight...

Momo: Barley, goodnight...

## Flying (Chapter 10)

Judy: Hey, does anyone else smell veggies?

Momo: Oh?

Judy: Isn't there something odd about the forest down there?

Momo: You're right! There's lots of huge vegetables sprouting there... looks weird...

Judy: Eeeeekkk! This fog stinks like celery on peppers!

Judy: Noooooo! We're being seasoneddddd!!!!

Unit 01: Wak wak! Do you ever stop complaining, Judy?!

Judy: Buutt... it stiiiiinnnnnks!

Momo: What was that?!

Unit 01: Qua?! I don't know! All of a sudden, our lift weakened!

Unit 01: WAAAAAK! We're quacked, Momo-chan!!

Unit 01: Dark Lord Cabbage's power is too great here-quaaack!

Unit 01: I can't keep everyone aloft in this green fog-wak!!

Momo: What? But it's just a little farther!

Unit 01: Waak! I'm sorry! If we don't land here I'll crash!

## Big veggie patch

Judy: Hurrrk... I can't go on.

Judy: Judy's... gonna... die...

Unit 01: Wak! Judy! Again with the whining! Can't you put up with it for Momo-chan-wak?

Judy: But... I HAAAAAAAATE VEGETABLES!!!! The smell is inside my nose... oh god, I'm gonna throw up...

Momo: Wow, I mean, veggies don't really... smell or anything...

Judy: WHAT! Are you kidding me?! Momo-chan, other than cauliflower, EVERYBODY HATES vegetables!

Momo: Huh?! Isn't that like a kindergarten attitude? I've been eating all kinds of vegetables since elementary school!

Judy: OOOFFF!!! I... I had no idea...

Judy: So, this, smell, it's... you're okay with it?

Momo: It's fine! It's fine! Look! *inhales deeply*

Judy: Uhghh-ghhg-hurrrrrrkkk.

Momo: Well, let's go.

Momo: What's wrong?

Unit 01: Momo-chan, around the time you were in kindergarten, is it possible you disliked cabbage?

Momo: You know, I guess I did hate it back then. Something about its lack of flavor, and the "jagujagu" feel of chewing it, just grossed me out. So like, if there was shredded cabbage in a salad or something, I'd always eat around it.

Clock: Just as I suspected!

Momo: But, I like it now! On hot-pot nights, cabbage is the best!... AH!

Momo: Could that be why...?!

Unit 01: That's it! The cabbage you hated... Dark Lord Cabbage... he became resentful. After being hated so much by your younger self, he's vowed to take his revenge on your present self!

Momo: So... the whole reason the Dark Lord Cabbage and his Veggie Corps rose up... my own likes and dislikes were the cause of it all?

Clock: The Dark Lord Cabbage still believes you despise his kind... but this is a misapprehension!

Clock: (Though needless to say, Judy does despise vegetables.)

Clock: Therefore, if we were to clear up this misunderstanding, perhaps...

Momo: But I'm not sure that's gonna be enough...

Momo: And how did this cabbage become a Dark Lord, anyhow? It can't just be cause I didn't particularly like cabbage...?

Clock: Hmmmm... While it is true that this Cabbage must have felt great resentment... I suppose not... Hrm... just a grudge...?

Captain: *Wurf!* Momo-chan, right now our first priority is to rescue Barley.

Momo: You're absolutely right! Let's go!

Unit 01: Momo-chan, look!

Momo: Yeah... the Dark Lord Cabbage is in there, I'm sure of it.

Clock: All right, let's GO!!!

Gunbot: ......

## Castle Gate (Chapter 11)

Unit 01: Look, a gate!

Momo: Let's get a closer look!

Unit 01: There's something written here-wak!

Clock: "WHOOO is the most fabulous in all the land?"

Judy: WHAT? This is so lame...

Momo: Looks like one of those doors that doesn't open without a code.

## Game: Gate Riddle

[If you keep entering random numbers, Mr. Clock will solve it for you, or you can answer it yourself using the hints they give you, read on...]

Shall we explain how to play?

- 👉Yes! explain
- I know, I'm good

I wonder what we should put in for the code? To enter a digit, press up and down on the D-pad and choose a number... up, up, up, down, down, down, down... Left and right change columns. Right, right, left, right, right, right.... If you're done entering the code... Use the A button to lock it in. Good luck, Momo-chan!

Clock: So, Momo-chan, what number will you enter?

👉0000

Captain: Seems like that wasn't it...

Captain: Momo-chan, was there a hint in there somewhere?

👉9999

Judy: Ahhh... it's no uuuuse! It won't opeeennn!

Momo: Yeah... ugh, this is really hard...

Unit 01: Quaack? Who the heck could "the most fabulous in all the land" be-waaakk??! Who indeed-wak!?

👉1337

Clock: The words inscribed on this plate must have another meaning. They must!

Judy: Why do you think that? That cabbage-head could have just written it to brag about himself!

Captain: The most fabulous in all the land...?

Captain: Certainly, the Dark Lord Cabbage has the most POWER in this World of Memories, but...

Momo: Cabbage... Hakusai... Ha-ku-sa-i...?

👉1234

Judy: It's no use! We're not going to get the code by guessing, no matter how many combinations of 4 numbers we try.

Momo: You're right...

Unit 01: Quaaack, you couldn't spell a word using 4 numbers, could you-wak?

Unit 01: Like "Yo-ro-shi-ku" from "4649", for example...

[Sounding out the numbers, 4=YOn 6=ROku 4=SHI 9=KU. Some numbers can be read in multiple ways like four is here.]

Judy: Mm? So "hakusai" would be...?

👉4321

Clock: Aha! By jove, I've got it! Judy, press the keys as I say:

Momo: Mr. Clock, you figured it out?

Clock: And just who do you think I am? Remember, I am a Gatekeeper! If it's a door, I'll handle it!!

Judy: So handle it already!!!

Clock: "WHOOO is the most fabulous in all the land?"... as this riddle must be referring to the Dark Lord Cabbage, the code is "hakusai", in other words, it must be "8-9-3-1"!!

[8=HAchi 9=KU 3=SAn 1=Ichi]

Momo: Ohhhh.... Incredible, Mr. Clock!!!

Judy: All right, here we go! 8, 9, 3, 1!

👉8931

Judy: Yattaaaa!! It opened!

### If you figure it out earlier

Judy: Wow!! How'd you?! That's our Momo-chan!

Judy: Genius!! Mad respect!!

Momo-1: QUAAAK?? Who knew Momo-chan had such mega brain power-waaaak?!

Captain: Hmm. Our Momo-chan was always a smart cookie!

Clock: We'll be breezing through Juku in style!

Momo: Hehehe... enough, enough.

Momo: All right, ready? Let's go!

## Castle Keep

Judy: Momo-chan, now's your chance, go ahead! Judy will distract them!

Captain: Momo-chan, it might be better if we split into two groups. If we all go at once, we'd be easily noticed.

Momo: All right, I'll go with Momo-1.

Unit 01: Quaaack... o- okay... I'll go... wak..

Captain: I'll be right behind you.

Clock: Hey! It's dangerous to go alone! I shall go with Captain.

Momo: OK. Mr. Clock, Captain is older, so be sure to do exactly as he says!

## Room with Many Doors

Judy: Alright, ready? Let's go, Momo-chan!

Judy: Hey! You! Come and get me!

Cuke: CyuuuuuuuuuuuuUU! Suspicious activity detected-cuke!!

Cuke: Suspicious-cuke! Suspicious-cuke!

Judy: Oh mister-cuukeypoo! Over this way!

Cuke: Wait-cuke! Waiiit-cuuuuke!

## Game: Cuke Chase

Shall we explain how to play?

- 👉Yes! explain
- I know, I'm good

All right, Momo-chan. You have to get across this room (using?) the doors Judy lured the Cukemen into! The exit is on the right side of the screen. If you cross the line of sight of a cukeman you'll be caught. Use the pillars to hide as you cross the room, so you won't be found!

[The cukemen can see you if there's a direct line north, south, east, or west between you of any distance. If ANY of teh cukemen see you, it's over. Periodically, Judy will lure them into a door and you can use this opportunity to dash with no risk.]

Momo: Momo-1, now!

Unit 01: Leave it to me-wak! Momo-chan, hold on tight!

*Momo makes it across*

Momo: Yatta! Next is Captain and Mr. Clock.

Unit 01: ....r- right, Momo-chan.

Momo: Momo-1?

Clock: It's our turn now, Captain. Let us go!

Captain: Hrm, well then, let's get to it.

[You'll notice these two move much more slowly. You'll have to start all the way over if you get caught, so proceed with caution and don't take any risks! Good luck!]

Judy: Eeeeeeek!!! Hold up! Is that as fast as you two can go!?

Cuke: Cyu-cyu-cyu-cyu-cyuuuuke! Wait-cuke! Waiiit-cuuuke!

### If you fail

Cuke: Cyu-cuke?

Cuke: Cyuuuuuuuuuuu! It's Momo-cuke!!

Cuke: Momo-cuke! Momo-cuke!

Cuke: If we catch her, Dark Lord Cabbage'll praise us!

Cuke: Praise-cuke! Praise-cuke!

Cuke: ...Catch heeeer-cuuuke!

Judy: Momo-chan, ruuuun!

Momo: Aaaahh! You say run but w- which way...!?

Momo-1: Quack quack! Any way, just RUN-WAK!!!

Captain: Where am I...? I'm completely lost.

Cuke: There-cuke! It's Captain-cuke!

Clock: Eeaaaghh! Quickly, ruuuunnnn!!!

Momo-1: Wak, wak! Where am I-wak? Which way-wak?

Momo: Waahhhh, we're completely lost!

Judy: Eeeek! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeagh! Where? Where? Where am I? I don't knowwww!!!

Momo: Judy!

Judy: Momo-chan!

Clock: Aaaawawawawwawa, Captain! Hurry! Hurry!

Captain: ......?

Captain: Ahhh! Momo-chan! Judy! And Momo-1!

Momo: Captain! Mr. Clock! You're all right!

Clock: *PHEW!* It seems, somehow, we all managed to get away.

Judy: Yeah, somehow.

Momo-1: Qua-quack? I can see light this way-wak!

Judy: That's... a little suspicious.

Captain: Yeess.... But we can't stay here like this.

Momo: That's right. All right, for now, let's check it out!

Momo: Huh? We're.......!?

Momo-1: It's the same passageway as before-wak!

Judy: Arrrrrrghghhh!

Cuke: But we was so close to catchin' Momo...

Cuke: CyuuuuuuuuuuuuUU! Regret-cuke! Regret-cuke!

Cuke: If we see her this time we're SURE to catch her-cuke!

Judy: *exhale* ALL RIGHT! Let's do this one more time!

Momo: Judy!

Judy: This time is gonna be perfect!

## After the Chase

Momo: Yatta!!!!

Momo: !?

Momo: Kyaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!

*Unit 01's axle breaks, sending Momo flying*

## Deep Within the Castle

Momo: Owwwww... Everyone okay?

Momo: Momo-1!!!!

Momo: Your front axle, it broke! How in the world did that happen?

Unit 01: Qua... quakkkk....

Unit 01: The mist that swallowed us up earlier... it rusted me out-wak... qua...

Momo: Momo-1... why?! Why didn't you say anything until now?

Unit 01: Wak... I'm sorry, Momo-chan...

Unit 01: Quaaa... I just wanted to stay by your side-wak...

Unit 01: I was able to help... one last time-wak...

Unit 01: But from here out you'll have to go without me...

Unit 01: Quaaack... Please, leave me here.

Momo: But, but...!

Judy: Puff, puff... it's no use... I'm tuckered out... puff...

Momo: Judy...... Momo-1.....!

Unit 01: Quackk!! Go, now! I'll be fine-wak!!

Unit 01: Waaak! Momo-chan! Don't let your memories die! Don't forget me. Don't forget us!

Momo: Momo-1...

Unit 01: QUAAAAAAAACK! Hurry! Go!

Cuke: Kyu-kyu? Think I heard somethin' over here!

Judy: Well... no way... around it... here I go... again!

Judy: Momo...chan... I believe in you... and Judy can do it too... but... I'll give these... cukes... one last chase...

Cuke: Kyu-kyu? This way!

Captain: Momo-chan, I will stay behind to protect Momo-1. So please, don't worry, go find Barley!

Clock: Such magnificent resolve, Captain, I expected no less! Come, Momo-chan! 

Momo: Captain, don't do anything rash! If you have the chance, run! Promise me!

Captain: *wurf!*

## Castle Hallway

Cuke 1: Ey, what was that doggie called? The one tha' Head Cabbage snatched up?

Cuke 2: Barley or somethin', cuke.

Cuke 1: He's a cukin' moron! He does nothin' but defy tha' Dark Lord, he's only gonna get the stink eye that way.

Barley: *whimper! whimper!*

Cuke 1: Kyu-kyu. He's makin' him do it again-cuke. Gettin' tormented like that every day, he's gotta be gettin' pretty weak-cuke.

Cuke 2: What a cukin' idiot! Speakin' of, if we don't get back to it, tha' Dark Lord's gonna compost us-cuke.

Cuke 1: Yer right-cuke.

Momo: Barley...

Clock: It is woeful, Barley seems to be suffering a great ordeal.

Momo: Mr. Clock, we have to hurry!

*They run off*

Momo: Ahhh!

*Momo trips over a trigger tile*

Momo: Owwww....

Clock: ???

Momo: No!!!

Clock: What!! The ceiling, it's...!!! Momo-chan! Look out!

Clock: Hurry! This way!

Momo: My leg...! My leg's hurt, I... I can't go any faster!

Momo: Aieeeeeee! It's over!

*flash*

Gunbot: NOOOOO!!!

Momo: GUNBOT!

Gunbot: No matter what! You're my second commander! -GUNNNN!!

Gunbot: I can't abandon you!!!

Gunbot: GOOOOOOO!!!

Momo: Gunbot! You came back for us!

Gunbot: Y- you remembered me-gun!

Gunbot: Momo-chan... you're my... second commander... after... all!

Gunbot: Momo-chan... hurry... run...-gun!!

Clock: Momo-chan! Quickly!

*She climbs out of harm's way*

Momo: Gunbot! I'm fine now! Hurry, drop it!

Gunbot: Negative...-gun... if I move... you'll... have no way... to get back..kk...k

Momo: What? No! That's crazy! Gunbot!!!

Gunbot: I am... a... super robot... I'll... be... fine... I'll... be...

Clock: Momo-chan! He is enduring!

Clock: Do not relinquish Gunbot's spirit! You must continue on!

Momo: Gunbot... I'm sorry... I'll come back for you!

Gunbot: It's... it's a... promise...-gun.... Momo-chan...

## Hallway

Barley: *wan!*

Cuke: Kyu-kyu!

Cuke: Did you hear something?

Cuke: Ahhh! It's Momo-cuke! It's Momo-cuke!!!!

Clock: Curses! We're found!

Cuke: Oiiii!!! Momo's here! Momo's over here!!!

Cuke: We got you now-cuke!!

Cukes: We got you-cuke! We got you-cuke!

Momo: Barley.......

## Cell

Momo: Barley! Barleyyy!!

Momo: Hang on, Barley!

Clock: Alas! it appears he is injured.

Clock: Barley! Do not overexert yourself!

Momo: Barley...

Barley: *whimper*

Momo: Barley... I'm sorry... It's my fault...

Momo: Barley! Where are you going?

Momo: Please, you have to sit still!

Momo: Barley! Please stop! I'm all right, please, don't do any more!

Momo: Barley...... Barley.......

## Game: The Final Countdown!

Shall we explain how to play?

- 👉Yes! explain
- I know, I'm good

Barley is trying desperately to save you! Momo, you have to cheer him on! To cheer, tap the A button repeatedly, as fast as you can! You can do it, Momo-chan!

Momo: Please, you can do it, Barley!

Momo: Barley, give it all you've got!

Momo: Hang in there, Barley!

Momo: You can do it!

Momo: You can do it, Barley!

Momo: Just a little more, Barley!

Momo: Almost there!!

## Doorway

Voice: Oh? It seems you've escaped your cage....

Pumpkin: But did you really think I'd just let you goooo?

TBC: Looks like you've jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire! GAAA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HAAAAA!

Voice: Mo-mo.....

Voice: One hundred years... I've waited for you...

Momo: The Dark Lord Cabbage!

Barley: *grrrrr!*

Momo: Barley! No! Stop it!

Clock: Momo-chan! What is wrong?!

DLC: Ho-hohhh, you would do well to stop right there, my Momo.

Momo: I didn't come here to fight you!

Momo: Listen! Dark Lord Cabbage! There's been a misunderstanding!

DLC: What's this?

Momo: When I was a child, I didn't like vegetables. But now! Now I'm older, and I'll eat anything!

DLC: And, so what, hmm?

Momo: I like them now! I love vegetables! So, stop all of this! Please!

Pumpkin: She lies, my lord!

TBC: That's right! You really think Momo, worldwide MVP of hating vegetables, up and switched teams just like that?

DLC: .........

Pumpkin: My lord! How many times did she leave us on her plate, surely you remember!

Pumpkin: Whenever we were in her salads, perfectly coated in dressing? "When, I wonder, will she finally eat me," we waited anxiously, heart pounding? No matter how long we waited, she wouldn't touch us...

TBC: That's right! One by one, she ate the tomatoes, then the lettuce... "Surely she must be saving me for last..." but, time and time again, it all ended with "May I be excused?"

Pumpkin: The only thing sadder is the parsley! On almost every dish, there it is, pretty as can be. But most times, nobody will even touch it!!!

TBC: That's right! After you tossed us veggies aside, do you even know what they did to us?!

Momo: *sniff*...

Pumpkin: We were.... we were... because we were just wasted, you see... we were used as fish food, tossed to the koi in the neighborhood park! Even though we were farmed in faraway fields, specifically to be eaten by people!

TBC: Those were the lucky ones! At least they got eaten, even if it was by a carp! Those of us who didn't become fish food, we'd wither to nothing in the refrigerator. And finally, in the end, it was into the garbage bag for us.

TBC: After everything is said and done, we were created just to be be thrown away, us veggies who came from faraway fields all the way to Momo's house.

Momo: I'm... I'm sorry! I'm really, really sorry!! But... but...

TBC: But what?!

Pumpkin: Don't make excuses!!

Momo: I know! I was in the wrong! But, every child has their likes and dislikes... and particularly vegetables... it was a weakness...

DLC: ...Momo-chan, I understand.

TBC: EEEEEehhhhhHHh!! Dark Lord Cabbaaaage?!

Pumpkin: Wh, what! What are you saying!?

Momo: Really?! You'll forgive me?

DLC: Yes, it's true. Momo-chan, you truly don't hate vegetables any more? You say you like us now, even cabbage?

Momo: Yes! I do!

DLC: So, back then, you couldn't STAND carrots. You say you LOVE them now?

Momo: Yeah! I love carrots on the side of a steak, they're are sweet and delicious!

DLC: Oh...? So how about peas? Back then you held your nose to eat green pea rice, you say you've grown to LOVE it?

Momo: W-well... green pea rice... um... I... I can eat it, but...

DLC: But of course, you LOVE it, right?

Momo: Umm.... yeeeeeeah... I... I like... I like it okay......

DLC: How about parsley? When you go out to eat, that parsley that you usually find perched on the edge of the plate? Of course, since you've grown to LOVE veggies, you must be sure to eat the parsley, too, never leaving it behind, you're saying?

Momo: Eh... p- parsley? Umm.... parsley... eheh...

DLC: Hmm? How about it...?

Momo: Umm.... Uhhhh... it's not that I HATE it... that is... I haven't gotten in the habit of eating it, per se....

DLC: .........

Momo: .........

DLC: EEEEEEEEIIIIIIDIOTTT!!!!! THEN HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU LOVE VEGGIIEEEEEEEEESSSSS!!?!??

DLC: WHAT COMPLETE AND UTTER LUNACY!!!!!

Momo: But!! W-wait-

DLC: SILENCE!!!!!!!

DLC: "Oohhh, I'm so grown up, I can eat you now... I just need to hold my nose!" You actually expect us to surrender, with this pathetic lie?!

TBC: UWAHAHA!!! My lord!! Now you're talking!

Pumpkin: Yeah yeah yeah! Any jerk who leaves the parsley CAN'T SAY THEY LOVE VEGGIES!!

Pumpkin: Us VEGETABLES see RIGHT THROUGH YOU, Momo!

Momo: But... Well, what do you want from me?!

DLC: Piss off back to the Real World, Momo-moron! WE. VEGGIES. HATE. YOU.

Momo: Dark Lord Cabbage...

DLC: That's all it is! We... I just HATE YOU!! You dummy!!

TBC: AH! My lord!!! Your... rear is showing!!!

[It reads "DUMMMY. HATE YOU."]

Momo: AH...! That's..!!

DLC: D- don't look.... don't look! Don't look at my butt!!

Momo: I remember now... writing it, when I was a little kid...

DLC: THAT, Momo!!

DLC: Your mom had just gone shopping, bought me, and brought me home for you, but you took me out and hid me away and you SCRIBBLED on me with CRAYONS!!!

[Little Momo writes "Dummy" on a cabbage in the photo]

Momo: AH!

DLC: You REMEMBER NOW???! How... how dare... HOW COULD YOUUUUU!!!

Momo: I... I... 

DLC: LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO MEEEEE!!!

DLC: WHY DO YOU HATE MEEEEEEEEE!!!

DLC: WHY WHY WHY WHYYYY DID YOU SCRIBBLE SUCH MEAN THINGS ON MEEEEE!!

DLC: I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU, MOMOOOOOOO!!!!

TBC: Pumpkin, let's do it!!!

Pumpkin: Hup!!

DLC: Stay out of this, you two! This battle is between me and Momo!!

TBC: Dark Lord...

Momo: I... did a horrible thing... I had forgotten...

Clock: Momo-chan, in order to grow up, children must forget their memories and dreams. They must let them go and walk away.

Clock: When you were little, you said you wanted to be an airline pilot, yes? But in reality, do that many people get to do that?

Clock: More importantly, remaining here is perilous! Run! Return to the Real World!

Momo: I can't. That would be just like an excuse.

Momo: Mr. Clock, look at the Dark Lord Cabbage! Look how hurt he is! Look how miserable! I.. I can't run away and leave him like this!

Clock: But! But he's too dangerous, he's ENRAGED!

Momo: If I go back like this, I'll forget about all of you a second time, right?! That's not how you treat people you care about! My childhood memories, my dreams, they're important... they're important parts of who I am!

Momo: Barley!

DLC: MOMO....!!! REMEMBEEEEEERRRR!!!!!

Momo: Stop! Barley's got nothing to do with this!

DLC: HIYAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!

Momo: BARLEYYYYYY!!!!

Captain: *WOOF!*

Momo: CAPTAIN!

Captain: *pant* *pant* can't... let Barley... die...

Captain: Barley's duty... in the Real World... to protect Momo-chan... *pant*

DLC: IDIOT! IDIOT!!!

DLC: Where'd you come from? You should have kept your dirty paws out of this!

Captain: ... protecting... Momo-chan... was... my...

Captain: du... ty......

Momo: Captain...?

Momo: ...... CAPTAIN!??

Momo: ...no...

Momo: ...you can't...

Momo: CAPTAIIIIINNN!!!!

Barley: *grrr!*

Momo: Barley! Stop!! It's no use!!

Barley: Momo... chan...

Barley: Protect    Momo-chan

Barley: Barley also    protect     Momo-chan!

Barley: *BITE!*

DLC: STUPID MUTT!

Momo: Please, stop!!!

DLC: GAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! Momo, no matter the tears you spill, this is your end.

Momo: ...*sob*...

Clock: Momo-chan!! The Door of Time! Quickly! You must run!!!

DLC: Time to finally do away with you!!!

Momo: Everyone... who stuck with me... who desperately tried to save me... everyone...

DLC: MOMO!! Disappear forever!!

Momo: Forgive me, I was weak... I wasn't even able to do this... for you... but...

Momo: I won't run away...!

Clock: Momo-chan! What are you doing?! Quickly!

DLC: I WAS SO ANGRYYYYYYYY!!!!!

Momo: I'm scared... but... I won't run...

Momo: At least, here, I can pray... for all of you... for the Dark Lord to find peace... until my last breath, I'll pray...

DLC: I WAS SO SAAAADDDDD!!!!!

Momo: For all the vegetables I hated as a child... I'm sorry... forgive me...

DLC: UWAAAAAAAAA!!!!

Momo: All the vegetables I had sad thoughts towards... somehow... everyone... forgive me... 

Momo: Every one... each and every one of you is a precious memory... I love you all... 

DLC: UWAAAAAAAAA!!!!



Voice: ... I ... was despised... I was sad... I just... wanted to be eaten..... that's all...

Voice: I'm sorry.... Momo-chan... thank you...


## Somewhere

Momo: Ah... everyone...!

Clock: Momo-chan, you did it!

Momo: Captain! Barley, are you?!

Clock: They will be all right. I have already checked on them. They have sustained injuries, but their lives are not in danger.

Momo: Judy...! Momo-1! Gunbot!!

Judy: Unnnnghh... it's no use... I can't run any more...

Unit 01: Waaakkk... I didn't know you were there, Momo-chan...

Gunbot: I've got the guts... I can take it-gun... Unnnngh....

Momo: You're all.... okay...!

Clock: It is a miracle... the Dark Lord Cabbage, he... disappeared completely!

Momo: Yeah... I... felt it? The Dark Lord, Pumpkin, Big Cabbage, at the last second they winked out....

Clock: Momo-chan, your heart opened up. We were all born again and returned to this world.

Momo: I wonder if we'll meet again, the Cabbages...

Clock: Do not worry, we are safe. So, allow me to bring everyone back to Grandpa's house.

Momo: Yeah, we need his help!


## Grandpa's (Chapter 12)

Momo: Hey everyone, let's take a photo! So after I go back to the Real World, I'll always have it to remember you by.

Judy: Yattaaa! Selfie! Selfie!

Judy: Judy in front!!!

# Post-Game

DLC: Momo-chan, should we make a seal commemorating our reconciliation?

- 👉 Yeah, let's make it!
- Ewwww, noooo

DLC: All right! Here we go, just wait a minute!

[Put some ascii art here?]

DLC: Hooo, there we are! Treasure it, Momo-chan.

DLC: Okay, actually, there's a second seal! Just another sec.

[More art or?]

DLC: Hooo, there we are! Treasure it, Momo-chan.

DLC: Well, this is the end. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll meet again some day.

DLC: Well then! Bye-bye, Momo-chan!

# OMAKE Menu

[Continue your saved game to get access to these goodies!]

DLC: I'm happy we could meet again, Momo-chan! It's been a while.

DLC: Actually, I have a sweet present for you!

DLC: Use the D-pad up and down, and the A button to choose. When you're ready to quit, use the B button.

- Make stickers from your memories
- Make a sticker with Barley
- Replay from your favorite scenes

## Memory Stickers

DLC: Here, you can make stickers out of Momo-chan's memories.

DLC: Choose a picture you want to make into a sticker using the D-pad up and down, and press the A button. Left and right will jump ahead, and use the B button when you're ready to quit.

[Pressing A here will print out the selected cutscene image on a standard single-size sticker. Some are marked with an asterisk `*`. After you print these, DLC will tell you that there's an extra story attached to the image, and give you the option to print the story too. These will just be white Japanese text on a black sticker, in case you're curious, they're probably not worth a precious sticker, but up to you!]

## Sticker with Barley

DLC: Here, you can make a sticker with Barley in your favorite pose. Use L and R to change Barley, the A button to make a seal, and the B button when you're ready to quit. 

DLC: Is this pose good?

Yes / No

[Oddly, DLC wants you to press buttons while he's speaking the the first bit of dialog ("here, you can..."). His dialog box won't go away while you use these controls: L and R actually change backgrounds not poses, and Barley will cycle through some animations on his own. Press A when he's got the pose you want to print, and B to quit. If you advance to the next bit of dialog where he says "Is this pose good?", A will print and B will go back to the first line of dialog.]

## Replay

DLC: Here, you can replay Momo's adventure from your favorite scene. Use the D-pad to choose, and press the A button. Use the B button when you want to quit.

👉 Chapter 1 - 12

DLC: Starting from chapter X, all right?

👉 Yes / No

DLC: Here you go, starting from chapter X!
