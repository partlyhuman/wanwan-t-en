## At home

D: I'm back!

R: Ahh, papa! Welcome home!

M: Welcome home, dear!

D: Roger, were you a good girl today?

R: Papa! Roger isn't a LITTLE KID any more!

D: Haha, is that right? But... today is a special day, isn't it?

R: Papa, you remembered? Today is Roger's birthday!

D: Of course! Well! Your present is in this room. Do you wanna look for it?

R: Whaaa?! What could it be?

P: *Kyuun!*

R: Eh? EHH?? Just now, was there a *kyuun*??

P: *Wan! Wan!*

R: UWAAAA! KAWAIII!!!! A PUPPYYYYY!!!!

R: PAPA!! A PUPPYYYYY!

P: *Wan!*

M: Ahh! A puppy! And what a cutey!

D: Hahaha, well, it has been quite a while since our old dog, Captain, passed away, hasn't it?

M: Roger-chan, won't you give our new family member a name?

R: Uhu, kawaii!!! A name... What should it be...

D: What name will you choose for the puppy? Use the D pad, A button, B button erases. (you get the drill)

(Doggie's name here. I'm gonna call him..... Bagel!)

D: Bagel. (Yes/No)

R: Bagel, your name is Bagel. Got it?

B: *Wan wan!*

R: Bagel! Bagel! Kawwwwaiii!

R: Such big ears! Hehe, looks like you could fly through the air.

R: Papa! THANK YOU!!

M: Roger. A puppy is a living thing, so you must cherish him and raise him well, you know.

M: You must not get tired of him or neglect him!

D: That's right, and you must train him well.

R: Train?

D: That's right. To start, it'd be best to teach him "sit".

R: How do we do that?

D: Papa will show you, so watch closely.

D: Okay, Roger? So, tap here, on bagel's back... and say "Sit!"

D: Bagel...

D: Sit!

D: Bagel, Bagel!

D: Sit! Bagel, sit!

D: Good! Good! You're a very smart boy, Bagel! You get it now?

B: *Wan wan!*

D: Gooood! Good boy, good boy!

D: So, Roger. Please try it like Papa showed you.

R: Okay!

- 👉Teach "sit"

R: Bagel!

R: Sit!

R: Bagel, sit!

B: .....

R: Bagel! Sit!

B: ??? *Wan wan!*

D: Goooood! Well! Next, bring him here!

D: Watch closely how Papa does this.

D: Bagel!

B: *Wan!*

D: Bagel. See the ball over there?

B: *Wan wan!*

D: Roger, teach Bagel with one of these balls.

R: OK!

R: Bagel!

R: Over here! The ball's over here!

D: Bagel, over there. There's the ball.

B: *Wan!*

D: Yes, Bagel! Go get it!

D: Bagel. Bring me the ball! Ball!

B: *Wan!* *Homf*

B: *Happy yip yap!!*

D: Good, just like that. Roger, now you try.

R: OK!

R: Bagel, come here!

B: *Wan!*

R: Good, Bagel! Good boy, good boy!

B: *Wan wan!*

R: Bagel, ball! That ball! Bring me that ball!

B: *Wan!*

R: Bagel, ball! Bring me the ball!

B: *sniff sniff*

R: No, Bagel....

R: Bagel! Go get the ball! Please!

B: *Yawn*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

R: .....BAGEL!! BALL! GET THE BALL!

B: *whimper*

D: Roger... Roger, you're getting a little frustrated, aren't you?

R: ?!

D: Bagel has a heart, you know. Since Bagel won't do what you want, you got a little frustrated, right? Bagel is very sensitive. He can understand your body language... and he won't come to you if you're irritated.

M: Right. So if Bagel fetches even once, maybe you should lavish him with praise! That would make him happy, very happy. If you do that, Bagel might bring you the ball to get that praise again!

R: Ohhhh..... OK, I got it! I won't get frustrated! I'll praise him a bunch!... Right?

R: Let's try it!

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

R: Bagel. Bring me the ball! Ball. The ball!

B: *Wan wan!*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

B: *Wan!*

R: Look, Bagel. Over there. Bring me that ball.

R: *Wan?*

R: Yes! Bring that ball!

R: *hehe*

R: Nooo, Bagel. Hm, he doesn't get it...

R: Look, Bagel. There. That ball.

B: *Wan wan! Wan wan!*

R: .....!!

B: *almoooost*

D: Look, Bagel! Over to Roger!

R: Bagel, bring me that ball like a good boy! Bagel!

B: *Wan!*

R: Bagel! Bring it. Bring it here!

B: *Fetches like a champ*

R: Bagel..... YOU DID IT! YOU FETCHED!

R: Bagel! Wonderful! Wonderful! Bagel is a very good boy!

R: Papa, Mama, Bagel finally learned how to fetch!

M: Yes, very good, Roger!

D: I think Bagel might have understood your heart, Roger.

B: *Wan wan!*

M: Sleep is very important for a puppy, isn't it? It would be very very bad for him to get sick. So! Let's put him to bed, shall we?

R: Haaaai.

D: Tomorrow you can play with the ball, Roger.

R: That's right! Good night, Bagel!

## At home

D: So, since today is Sunday, wouldn't it be nice to go play ball with bagel in the park!

R: Yeah! Let's go! Bagel!!

B: *Wan! Wan!*

R: Be back sooooon!

M: Take care!

# Chapter 2

## At the park

R: Good, Bagel! Can you fetch this? Here we go!

- 👉Throw gently
- Throw hard

R: There!

R: Bagel, amazing! You learned how to fetch perfectly!

R: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

R: There!

B: *Epic jump catch*

R: Awesome, Bagel! How come you can do that, I never taught you?!

R: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

R: Okaaay, this next one is kinda hard, can you do it?

R: Okay, here we go, Bagel! THERE!

B: *Jumps into bush*

R: Bagellll, you there?

R: ....Bagellll

R: Bagel, Bagel! Come! Come back!

R: Bagellll. (While calling out Bagel's name, I felt hungry all of a sudden...)

R: Bagellll.... What happened....

B: *Jumps out with a definitely not creepy doll*

R: BAGEL!

R: What were you doinnng? I was worrrieedd!

R: Wh, what's that? You picked up something other than the ball...

B: *Wan!*

R: That... That doll, where do I...?

R: Oh... Long ago, when we had to move here...

R: Umm, hmmm...

R: It was really important, so why can't I remember...

R: Judy... That's it! This is Judy!!!

B: *Wan wan!*

J: *JUMPS TO LIFE TERRIFYINGLY*

J: YOU REMEMBERED ME, ROGER-CHAN!!!

R: Eh? Eh?? EEHHHH???

J: Roger-chan! Rogerland... it's-

J: Quick, quick! It's important... it's precious...

C: *A mustachioed alarm clock jumps out of the bush, because why not*

C: Aaahhhhhh, aaah, ahem! Greetings!

R: W-wh-why!?? This.... alarm clock... is... moving?!

J: Shut up!! As I was saying, ROGERLAND IS PRECIOUS!

J: Therefore, Roger-chan, you have to come with me... to Rogerland!

R: Eh? EEEEEHHH?? What are you saying?!

R: I don't understand!

C: Ahem! Ahem!

C: As a subject of Rogerland, you are acting most deplorable, Judy.

[RR it's him not R right?]

C: As the caretaker of the Door of Time, I must beg your forgiveness for coming to the World of Reality at my own regrettable pace.

C: Yes, I have returned, I have returned!

J: Ugh, I have to put up with this? Will you be quiet, old man!?

C: Hmf...

C: Ahem! You may call me Clock!

C: As I was saying, I am the keeper of the Door of Time, that connects Rogerland and the World of Reality.

C: By the way, Roger-chan, it is almost time to go to JUKU.

J: Ugh! Enough about Juku, who cares!

J: Please, Roger-chan, there's no time. Look at this!

R: That's... Whose photo album is that?

R: .....That's my album!

R: How? Why?!

*A photo straight up disappears as you watch*

R: EEEH? The photo, it.... vanished!

J: Do you see why Rogerland is precious now?

J: If things keep going this way, Roger-chan's memories will ALL BE GONE!

J: If I was just a little bit later, even your memory of me might have died...

C: Judy, the closing of the Door of Time will soon be upon us! Let us return!

J: Please, Roger-chan! Please don't forget about me!

J: Let's stay friends forever, please...

R: Of- Of course we're friends, Judy!

R: But, WHERE IS ROGERLAND?

R: So I have to go to "Juku"...?

C: It's time, Judy! In 20 seconds... 19...

R: But I still have questions! ...And if I'm late for dinner, Papa will scold me...

C: 15... 14... 13...

R: Umm.... l.. look, even if we were to go to Rogerland, don't we need to prepare?

R: You know, like, things we need to bring, and... making arrangements...

C: 10... Judy, there's no time!

C: 8... Do you want to be stuck here!? 7...

J: Roger-chan! It's like I said... so... let's go!

J: I can explain better after we get there!

R: Eeehh! That... Judy!!!

*Everyone jumps back into the bushes*

R: Mr. Clock!

B: *Wan!* *Jumps in the bushes*

R: Ah... Bagel! Oh... wait for meeeeeeeeee!

## Forest

Voice: Roger...

Voice: Roger-chan...

R: *Waking up* Mama? What time is it?

B: *lick*

R: Kya! Bagel... Where am i?

C: Roger-chan, this is Rogerland.

R: Mr. Clock... Judy...!

R: We really came to... the land of memories...

J: Is Roger-chan going to be okay?

C: As we were not able to get to Juku in time, we are in a predicament...

J: Of course we're in a "predicament"!

C: Not "of course", Judy. Carelessly allowing the time to become so late is a serious affair!

J: UGHHH! To begin with, won't you shut up with your "time", "time", "time"!

J: Don't tell me you've never been just a teeny, tiny, little bit late yourself!

C: Never.

C: I have periodic checkups once every two months, without fail. Therefore, I am never late, not even a single second.

R: ... I guess we're here now... We gotta do what we gotta do...

R: So, Judy, what should I do here?

J: To tell the truth, lately in Rogerland, the Veggies have been stirring up a rebellion. It's like, a big pain for everyone!

J: Even Judy's favorite ribbon was taken...

J: The disappearance of Roger-chan's memories is also their doing.

R: But why would... vegetables... do that kind of thing?

*Cue dramatic music*

[Or Demon King Cabbage or maybe Evil Cabbage King?]

J: It's the "Dark Lord Cabbage"! He's their super evil leader!

J: He's the one ordering the Veggies around.

R: Dark Lord Cabbage?

J: The way I heard it, Dark Lord Cabbage is gradually eating your memories...

J: Roger-chan, it seemed like even your memories of me would be forgotten!!!

R: Dark Lord Cabbage...

R: So unless I defeat him, my precious memories will vanish, huh?

C: Ahem. Roger-chan. It seems we have dragged you along and gotten you involved in this turmoil, but as a citizen of the World of Reality, walking about Rogerland is simply unacceptable.

C: So! I have made arrangements for your return.

R: Eh! I can return?

C: Naturally, as long as you are together with I, the Keeper of the Door of Time, you may any time open the door and return home. So let us return!

J: Mr. Clock, don't you know this is a serious affair?!

C: Silence!

C: Her presence is strictly prohibited by the 11th article of the Principles of Door Management!

J: Why you! This Rogerland we're in is the world of Roger's memories, you know.

C: So, what are you saying?

J: You don't get it yet? All that tick-tocking must have made your head go stupid.

J: If this keeps going, and all Roger-chan's memories are taken away; if she turns into an adult with no memories of her childhood, the World of Reality and the World of Memories will be completely severed and set adrift!

J: If that happens, you're out of a job! The Door of Time becomes totally obsolete!

J: And if nobody needs the Door of Time, nobody needs the Janitor of the Door of Time, do they now?!

C: Wh- What? Me, become useless?

C: That IS a serious affair. I see no helping it, I shall grant you special permission.

C: However, I shall accompany you, performing the duty of official overseer.

C: Well then, let us briskly and without sluggishness return these memories.

R: But... how?

B: *Wan wan!*

C: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH! DOG!! THERE!!! REMAIN CALM!

R: Bagel, what is it?

R: Could Bagel have found something that could be a clue?

J: If so, he may be small, but he's certainly a very helpful dog!

R: Bagel, it's all you!

B: *Wan wan!*

## Tree

R: Huff huff... Bagel.... huff... is there something... huff... about this tree?

B: *Wan wan!*

Voice: Ahhhhh, help meee!
